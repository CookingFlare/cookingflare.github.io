Chicken Shawarma, typically made with marinated chicken that is slow-cooked until it’s tender, juicy, and infused with spices, can now be easily prepared with a pressure cooker, saving you both time and effort.</p><p>In this blog post, we’ll walk you through the step-by-step process of making a succulent Instant Pot Chicken Shawarma, perfect for weeknight dinners, meal prep, or impressing guests at a gathering. The key to great shawarma lies in the seasoning and cooking technique, so let’s dive into the world of this delectable dish!</p><h2 id=what-is-shawarma>What is Shawarma?</h2><p>Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish that originated in the Levant region. It is typically made by stacking thinly sliced pieces of meat—often lamb, beef, or chicken—on a vertical rotisserie. The meat is seasoned with a mixture of spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and paprika, then slow-cooked and shaved off as it crisps up. Shawarma is usually served in pita bread or flatbreads and topped with a variety of fresh vegetables, sauces like tahini or garlic sauce, and sometimes pickles.</p><p>While traditional shawarma requires specialized equipment and hours of preparation, this Instant Pot version is a quick and easy way to enjoy all of its rich flavors in a fraction of the time.</p><h2 id=why-use-the-instant-pot-for-chicken-shawarma>Why Use the Instant Pot for Chicken Shawarma?</h2><p>Using the Instant Pot to make chicken shawarma is a game-changer for several reasons:</p><ol><li><strong>Speed</strong>: The pressure cooking function of the Instant Pot helps tenderize the chicken in a fraction of the time it would take on a stovetop or in the oven.</li><li><strong>Flavor</strong>: The sealed environment of the Instant Pot locks in all the spices and juices, creating a flavorful, juicy chicken that’s packed with Middle Eastern flavors.</li><li><strong>Convenience</strong>: With just a few ingredients, you can throw everything into the Instant Pot and let it do the work for you.

Let’s get started with the ingredients you’ll need and the step-by-step process for making Instant Pot Chicken Shawarma.</p><h2 id=ingredients-for-instant-pot-chicken-shawarma>Ingredients for Instant Pot Chicken Shawarma</h2><p>Here’s what you’ll need to prepare this delicious dish:</p><h3 id=for-the-chicken-marinade>For the Chicken Marinade:</h3><ul><li>2 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken thighs (for the best flavor and tenderness)</li><li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li><li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li><li>1 tablespoon ground paprika</li><li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li><li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li><li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li><li>1 teaspoon ground allspice</li><li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li><li>½ teaspoon ground cloves</li><li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li><li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li><li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li></ul><h3 id=for-cooking>For Cooking:</h3><ul><li>1 cup chicken broth or water</li><li>1 onion, thinly sliced (optional, for extra flavor)</li></ul><h3 id=for-serving>For Serving:</h3><ul><li>Warm pita bread or flatbread</li><li>Fresh vegetables like tomatoes, cucumber, and red onion, sliced thinly</li><li>Tahini sauce or garlic sauce</li><li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)</li><li>Pickled vegetables (optional)</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-make-instant-pot-chicken-shawarma>How to Make Instant Pot Chicken Shawarma</h2><p>Now that you’ve got your ingredients ready, let’s break down the process of making Chicken Shawarma in the Instant Pot.</p><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-chicken-marinade>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken Marinade</h3><p>Start by preparing the marinade for the chicken. In a large bowl, combine all the spices—cumin, paprika, coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and cloves. Add the minced garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, and apple cider vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Mix well until all the ingredients are combined into a fragrant, thick paste.</p><p>Take your boneless, skinless chicken thighs and coat them thoroughly with the marinade. Make sure each piece of chicken is evenly covered with the spice mixture. For the best flavor, let the chicken marinate for at least 30 minutes, though if you have time, allowing it to sit for a few hours (or even overnight) will intensify the flavors.</p><h3 id=step-2-sauté-the-chicken-optional>Step 2: Sauté the Chicken (Optional)</h3><p>While this step is optional, searing the chicken before pressure cooking can help lock in flavors and give the chicken a slight caramelized texture.</p><p>Turn your Instant Pot to the “Sauté” mode and add a tablespoon of olive oil. Once the pot is hot, add the marinated chicken thighs. Brown the chicken for about 2-3 minutes on each side until they develop a rich golden-brown color. Remove the chicken and set it aside. If you prefer not to sear the chicken, you can skip this step and move on to pressure cooking.</p><h3 id=step-3-add-the-onion-and-broth>Step 3: Add the Onion and Broth</h3><p>If you’re using onions, slice them thinly and add them to the Instant Pot. The onions will infuse the dish with a savory sweetness as they cook. Pour in the chicken broth or water, scraping the bottom of the pot to deglaze any browned bits left from sautéing the chicken. This step helps build flavor and prevents the “burn” notice from appearing during cooking.</p><h3 id=step-4-pressure-cook-the-chicken>Step 4: Pressure Cook the Chicken</h3><p>Return the browned (or raw) chicken thighs to the Instant Pot. Seal the lid, ensuring the pressure valve is set to “Sealing.” Select the “Pressure Cook” or “Manual” setting and set the timer for 12 minutes on high pressure. Once the cooking cycle is complete, allow the Instant Pot to release pressure naturally for 5-10 minutes before carefully turning the valve to release any remaining pressure.</p><h3 id=step-5-shred-the-chicken>Step 5: Shred the Chicken</h3><p>Once the chicken is cooked through and tender, remove it from the Instant Pot and place it on a cutting board. Use two forks to shred the chicken into bite-sized pieces. The meat should be incredibly tender, with all the spices absorbed into the fibers.</p><h3 id=step-6-assemble-the-shawarma>Step 6: Assemble the Shawarma</h3><p>Now comes the fun part—assembling your shawarma! Warm your pita bread or flatbread, and layer it with the shredded chicken. Add some fresh vegetables like tomatoes, cucumber, and red onion, along with a drizzle of creamy tahini sauce or garlic sauce. If you like a bit of tang, consider adding some pickled vegetables. Garnish with fresh parsley for a burst of color and flavor.</p><h3 id=step-7-serve-and-enjoy>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Once everything is assembled, roll up the shawarma in the bread, and enjoy! This Instant Pot Chicken Shawarma is perfect for a quick lunch, dinner, or meal prep for the week ahead. The tender chicken, combined with the aromatic spices and fresh toppings, creates a perfect balance of savory, spicy, and tangy flavors.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-best-instant-pot-chicken-shawarma>Tips for the Best Instant Pot Chicken Shawarma</h2><ul><li><strong>Use Chicken Thighs</strong>: Chicken thighs are the best cut for shawarma because they’re juicier and more flavorful than chicken breasts. They also stay tender even when pressure-cooked.</li><li><strong>Make It Ahead</strong>: You can make the chicken ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The flavors will continue to develop, making it even better the next day.</li><li><strong>Add Your Favorite Toppings</strong>: Customize your shawarma with your favorite toppings! Some options include hummus, feta cheese, or a squeeze of lemon juice.</li><li><strong>Don’t Skip the Marination</strong>: The longer you marinate the chicken, the more flavorful it will be. If you’re short on time, 30 minutes of marinating will still yield a delicious result.</li></ul><h2 id=why-youll-love-this-recipe>Why You’ll Love This Recipe</h2><p>This Instant Pot Chicken Shawarma recipe is perfect for anyone who loves Middle Eastern cuisine but doesn’t want to spend hours preparing it.
