Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</p><p>Toss the peeled, cubed squash with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread the squash evenly on a baking sheet, ensuring the pieces are not overcrowded. Roast for about 25-30 minutes, or until the squash is tender and lightly browned on the edges. Check with a fork to ensure it&rsquo;s fully cooked.</p><p>Once roasted, let the squash cool slightly before using a fork or potato masher to mash it into a smooth puree. For added flavor, you can mix in a pinch of ground nutmeg or freshly chopped thyme or sage, though this is entirely optional.</p><h3 id=step-2-making-the-ravioli-dough>Step 2: Making the Ravioli Dough</h3><p>While the squash is roasting, it&rsquo;s a great time to prepare the ravioli dough. In a large bowl, combine the flour and a pinch of salt. Make a well in the center and crack the eggs into the well, then add the olive oil. Use a fork to whisk the eggs and oil together, slowly incorporating the flour into the mixture.</p><p>Once the dough starts coming together, transfer it to a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 10 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough is too dry, add a bit of water, a tablespoon at a time, until it comes together. If it&rsquo;s too sticky, sprinkle in a little more flour.</p><p>Once the dough is smooth, wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature. Resting the dough allows the gluten to relax, making it easier to roll out and shape.</p><h3 id=step-3-preparing-the-ravioli-filling>Step 3: Preparing the Ravioli Filling</h3><p>In a mixing bowl, combine the mashed butternut squash with the ricotta and Parmesan cheeses. Stir in the egg to bind everything together. Taste the mixture and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. The filling should be creamy and flavorful, with just enough richness from the cheeses and subtle warmth from the nutmeg.</p><h3 id=step-4-rolling-and-assembling-the-ravioli>Step 4: Rolling and Assembling the Ravioli</h3><p>After the dough has rested, it&rsquo;s time to roll it out. Using a pasta machine or a rolling pin, roll the dough into thin sheets, about 1/16 inch thick. Lay one sheet of pasta on a clean, floured surface.</p><p>Spoon small mounds of the butternut squash filling onto the dough, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Be careful not to overfill the ravioli, as it can cause the dough to burst during cooking.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve placed all the filling, lay a second sheet of pasta over the top of the first. Press down gently around each mound of filling to seal the ravioli, then use a ravioli cutter or a sharp knife to cut out the individual pieces.</p><p>To ensure your ravioli are sealed properly, press the edges with a fork to create a decorative border and ensure the filling stays inside while cooking.</p><h3 id=step-5-cooking-the-ravioli>Step 5: Cooking the Ravioli</h3><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Gently drop the ravioli into the boiling water, a few at a time, and cook for about 3-4 minutes or until they float to the surface. Fresh ravioli cooks quickly, so be careful not to overcook them.</p><p>Once cooked, use a slotted spoon to remove the ravioli from the water and set them aside on a plate.</p><h3 id=step-6-making-the-sage-brown-butter-sauce>Step 6: Making the Sage Brown Butter Sauce</h3><p>Now it&rsquo;s time for the delicious brown butter sauce. In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Let the butter cook for a few minutes, swirling occasionally, until it turns golden brown and starts to smell nutty. Be sure to keep an eye on it, as it can burn quickly once it starts browning.</p><p>Add the minced garlic to the skillet and cook for about 1 minute, until fragrant. Next, add the fresh sage leaves and cook for another 2-3 minutes, until the sage becomes crispy and aromatic.</p><p>Once the butter has browned and the sage is crispy, remove the skillet from the heat. Add a splash of lemon juice to brighten up the sauce and give it a fresh, tangy contrast to the richness of the butter.</p><h3 id=step-7-serving-the-dish>Step 7: Serving the Dish</h3><p>To serve, gently toss the cooked ravioli in the sage brown butter sauce, making sure each piece is coated in the flavorful sauce. You can also plate the ravioli individually, spooning the brown butter sauce over the top. Finish with a generous sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan cheese for an added layer of flavor and richness.</p><p>Garnish with a few extra crispy sage leaves for a beautiful, aromatic touch that will also add a lovely texture to each bite.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfecting-your-butternut-squash-ravioli>Tips for Perfecting Your Butternut Squash Ravioli</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Make Ahead</strong>: You can prepare the ravioli dough and filling ahead of time. Store the ravioli in the refrigerator or freezer and cook them when you&rsquo;re ready to enjoy them. Just be sure to freeze them on a baking sheet in a single layer before transferring them to a storage bag, so they don&rsquo;t stick together.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Fresh Sage</strong>: Fresh sage is key to the flavor of the sauce. It has a more delicate, fragrant taste compared to dried sage, and when fried in butter, it becomes wonderfully crispy and adds a lovely texture to the dish.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Overfill</strong>: When making ravioli, it&rsquo;s tempting to overstuff, but this can cause the ravioli to break open while cooking. Stick to about one teaspoon of filling per ravioli for the perfect ratio of pasta to filling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customize the Filling</strong>: While butternut squash is the star of this dish, you can experiment with other vegetables or cheeses to make the filling your own. Try adding caramelized onions, goat cheese, or even roasted mushrooms for a unique twist.</p></li></ol><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Butternut squash ravioli with sage brown butter sauce is a truly satisfying and flavorful dish, perfect for the fall season or anytime you&rsquo;re craving something comforting yet elegant. The sweetness of the roasted squash pairs beautifully with the savory, nutty brown butter sauce, while the tender ravioli brings it all together. Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned cook or a beginner in the kitchen, this recipe is sure to impress. It&rsquo;s a celebration of autumn&rsquo;s finest flavors, wrapped in a delicate, homemade ravioli.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/categories/pasta-dishes/>Pasta Dishes</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/budget-friendly-pasta-recipes-delicious-meals-on-a-dime/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Budget-Friendly Pasta Recipes: Delicious Meals on a Dime</span>
