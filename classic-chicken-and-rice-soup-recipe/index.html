This timeless recipe combines tender chicken, aromatic vegetables, and fluffy rice, simmered together in a flavorful broth to create a meal that&rsquo;s as satisfying as it is soothing. Whether you&rsquo;re cooking for your family, treating yourself to something cozy, or looking for a way to use up leftover chicken, this soup is the perfect choice.</p><h2 id=ingredients>Ingredients</h2><p>Before diving into the cooking process, it’s important to gather all of your ingredients. The beauty of this soup is in its simplicity, so you don’t need to hunt for hard-to-find items. Most of these ingredients are pantry staples or easy to find at your local grocery store.</p><ul><li><strong>1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs</strong> (chopped into bite-sized pieces)</li><li><strong>2 tablespoons olive oil</strong></li><li><strong>1 medium onion</strong> (finely chopped)</li><li><strong>2 garlic cloves</strong> (minced)</li><li><strong>2 medium carrots</strong> (peeled and sliced)</li><li><strong>2 celery stalks</strong> (chopped)</li><li><strong>1 cup long-grain white rice</strong></li><li><strong>4 cups chicken broth</strong> (low-sodium recommended)</li><li><strong>2 cups water</strong></li><li><strong>1 teaspoon dried thyme</strong></li><li><strong>1 teaspoon dried parsley</strong></li><li><strong>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</strong></li><li><strong>1/2 teaspoon salt</strong> (adjust to taste)</li><li><strong>2 bay leaves</strong></li><li><strong>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</strong> (optional, for a burst of freshness)</li><li><strong>1 tablespoon butter</strong> (optional, for extra richness)</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-make-classic-chicken-and-rice-soup>How to Make Classic Chicken and Rice Soup</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-chicken>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3><p>To start, you’ll need your chicken. You can use boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs—both work well, but chicken thighs tend to add a bit more flavor due to their higher fat content. If you don’t have raw chicken on hand, feel free to use leftover cooked chicken, such as rotisserie chicken. Simply shred the cooked chicken before adding it to the soup later in the process.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re using raw chicken, chop it into bite-sized pieces. The smaller pieces allow the chicken to cook quickly and evenly, blending perfectly into the soup.</p><h3 id=step-2-sauté-the-vegetables>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3><p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté the vegetables for about 5-7 minutes, or until the onions become translucent and the carrots and celery soften slightly. This step helps release the flavors of the vegetables, creating a rich base for your soup.</p><p>Next, add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute. Garlic is known for its aromatic qualities, and it’ll begin to infuse the oil with a savory scent, which will form the backbone of the soup’s flavor profile.</p><h3 id=step-3-brown-the-chicken>Step 3: Brown the Chicken</h3><p>Add the chicken pieces to the pot and cook for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure all sides of the chicken are browned and cooked through. The goal is to lightly sear the chicken, which will enhance the overall flavor of the soup. You don’t need to fully cook the chicken through at this stage since it will continue cooking once the broth is added.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-the-broth-and-rice>Step 4: Add the Broth and Rice</h3><p>Once the chicken is browned, it’s time to introduce the liquid components. Pour in the chicken broth and water, stirring to combine. Make sure to scrape the bottom of the pot to release any browned bits from the chicken and vegetables—these are full of flavor and will enhance the overall taste of your soup.</p><p>Next, add the rice, dried thyme, dried parsley, bay leaves, salt, and pepper. The rice will absorb the broth as it cooks, adding a wonderful texture to the soup. Stir everything together to ensure the rice is evenly distributed.</p><h3 id=step-5-simmer-the-soup>Step 5: Simmer the Soup</h3><p>Now that everything is in the pot, bring the soup to a boil over high heat. Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the soup simmer gently for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the chicken is cooked through. During this time, the flavors will meld together, and the soup will thicken slightly from the rice.</p><p>It’s important to check the soup occasionally, stirring gently to make sure the rice doesn&rsquo;t stick to the bottom of the pot. If the soup is getting too thick, feel free to add a little more water or chicken broth to reach your desired consistency.</p><h3 id=step-6-final-touches>Step 6: Final Touches</h3><p>Once the rice is tender and the chicken is cooked, remove the pot from the heat. Discard the bay leaves and stir in the fresh lemon juice, if using. The acidity from the lemon juice brightens up the soup, giving it a little extra layer of flavor. If you prefer a creamier texture, you can also stir in a tablespoon of butter at this point, which adds richness to the broth.</p><p>Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Depending on your preferences, you might want to add more salt, pepper, or herbs. Once everything is perfectly balanced, your chicken and rice soup is ready to be served.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-perfect-chicken-and-rice-soup>Tips for the Perfect Chicken and Rice Soup</h2><h3 id=use-fresh-herbs-for-extra-flavor>Use Fresh Herbs for Extra Flavor</h3><p>While dried herbs work great in this soup, fresh herbs can make a significant difference. If you have fresh thyme or parsley on hand, try adding them at the end of cooking, just before serving. Fresh herbs have a more vibrant and aromatic flavor that will elevate the soup to the next level.</p><h3 id=swap-out-the-rice>Swap Out the Rice</h3><p>Although long-grain white rice is a classic choice for chicken and rice soup, feel free to experiment with other types of rice. Brown rice can add a nutty flavor and a slightly chewier texture. You could also use jasmine or basmati rice for a more fragrant soup. Just keep in mind that different rice varieties may have different cooking times, so be sure to adjust the simmering time accordingly.</p><h3 id=add-more-vegetables>Add More Vegetables</h3><p>To make this soup even more nutritious, consider adding additional vegetables. Frozen peas, corn, or spinach are all great options that will blend well with the existing ingredients. If you&rsquo;re looking for a heartier soup, you could even add potatoes or parsnips for extra texture and flavor.</p><h3 id=make-it-in-a-slow-cooker>Make It in a Slow Cooker</h3><p>For a hands-off version of this soup, you can easily make it in a slow cooker. Simply add all of the ingredients (except the rice and lemon juice) to the slow cooker and cook on low for 6-8 hours or on high for 3-4 hours. About 30 minutes before serving, stir in the rice and cook until tender. Finish with a squeeze of lemon juice to brighten up the flavors.</p><h3 id=store-and-reheat-leftovers>Store and Reheat Leftovers</h3><p>This chicken and rice soup makes great leftovers, as the flavors continue to meld over time. Store any leftover soup in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. When reheating, you may need to add a little extra broth or water, as the rice will absorb more liquid as it sits.</p><p>If you want to freeze the soup, it can be stored in a freezer-safe container for up to 3 months. When ready to enjoy, simply thaw it overnight in the fridge and reheat on the stove. The rice may soften a bit after freezing, but the soup will still be delicious and comforting.</p><h2 id=why-chicken-and-rice-soup-is-the-ultimate-comfort-food>Why Chicken and Rice Soup is the Ultimate Comfort Food</h2><p>Chicken and rice soup has long been a favorite comfort food in many cultures.
