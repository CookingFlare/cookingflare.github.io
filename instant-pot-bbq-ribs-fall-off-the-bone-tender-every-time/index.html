But if you don’t have hours to slow cook or the perfect grill setup, don’t worry! The Instant Pot has you covered, allowing you to create fall-off-the-bone tender BBQ ribs in a fraction of the time. This method is incredibly simple, quick, and yields deliciously juicy ribs with a caramelized BBQ glaze that will rival any BBQ joint.</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve been hesitant to try cooking ribs at home, the Instant Pot is a game changer. By using pressure cooking, it breaks down the meat fibers in a way that ensures the ribs are meltingly tender. Paired with your favorite BBQ sauce, this recipe offers the perfect balance of smokiness, sweetness, and spice. Whether you&rsquo;re preparing for a weeknight dinner or a weekend cookout, these Instant Pot BBQ ribs will become a staple in your cooking repertoire.</p><h2 id=why-use-an-instant-pot-for-bbq-ribs>Why Use an Instant Pot for BBQ Ribs?</h2><p>Cooking ribs traditionally on the grill or in the oven can take several hours, and while the results are fantastic, it&rsquo;s not always feasible if you&rsquo;re short on time. The Instant Pot significantly reduces cooking time, while still delivering incredible flavors and that sought-after tenderness.</p><p>One of the biggest advantages of using an Instant Pot is its ability to lock in moisture and cook meat quickly while retaining all the juices and flavors. The sealed environment within the Instant Pot ensures that the ribs cook evenly and tenderize thoroughly. No more worrying about dry or overcooked ribs!</p><h3 id=instant-pot-bbq-ribs-what-youll-need>Instant Pot BBQ Ribs: What You&rsquo;ll Need</h3><p>Before diving into the recipe, make sure you have the right ingredients and tools to prepare your ribs. Here&rsquo;s a list of what you&rsquo;ll need to get started:</p><h4 id=ingredients>Ingredients:</h4><ul><li><strong>Ribs</strong> – Pork ribs are commonly used for this recipe. You can use baby back ribs or spare ribs, depending on your preference.</li><li><strong>BBQ Sauce</strong> – Choose a store-bought sauce or your own homemade favorite. A thick and tangy BBQ sauce works best.</li><li><strong>Spices</strong> – A mix of spices will enhance the flavor of the ribs. You’ll need garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, brown sugar, salt, and black pepper.</li><li><strong>Apple Cider Vinegar</strong> – This helps tenderize the meat and adds a slight tang to balance out the sweetness of the BBQ sauce.</li><li><strong>Chicken Broth</strong> – Adds moisture to the Instant Pot, which helps cook the ribs while preventing them from drying out.</li></ul><h4 id=tools>Tools:</h4><ul><li><strong>Instant Pot</strong> – Any size Instant Pot will work, but the 6-quart model is perfect for a rack of ribs.</li><li><strong>Trivet</strong> – A small metal stand that keeps the ribs elevated above the liquid, ensuring they don’t sit in the broth during cooking.</li><li><strong>Sharp Knife</strong> – For trimming the ribs if necessary.</li><li><strong>Basting Brush</strong> – For applying the BBQ sauce after cooking.</li><li><strong>Tongs</strong> – To handle the ribs when transferring them from the Instant Pot to the broiler or grill.</li></ul><h3 id=preparing-the-ribs>Preparing the Ribs</h3><p>The first step to making delicious Instant Pot BBQ ribs is prepping the meat. You want to remove any excess fat, trim the ribs to fit into your Instant Pot, and remove the silver skin. The silver skin is a thin membrane on the back of the ribs that can be tough and chewy when cooked. Removing it ensures that the ribs become tender and more flavorful.</p><p>To remove the silver skin, use a sharp knife to lift one corner of the membrane, then grip it with a paper towel to pull it off in one piece. Once the ribs are prepped, cut them into smaller sections if necessary so they can fit comfortably inside the Instant Pot. This may involve cutting the rack into halves or thirds.</p><h3 id=making-the-dry-rub>Making the Dry Rub</h3><p>While you can always use store-bought rubs, making your own dry rub at home is simple and allows you to tailor the flavors to your taste. Here&rsquo;s a quick and easy rub to apply to the ribs:</p><h4 id=ingredients-for-dry-rub>Ingredients for Dry Rub:</h4><ul><li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li><li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li><li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li><li>1 tablespoon paprika (smoked paprika works best)</li><li>1 teaspoon salt</li><li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li></ul><p>Simply mix all the ingredients together in a small bowl. Then, rub the mixture generously on both sides of the ribs. Massage it into the meat to ensure an even coating. Let the ribs sit for about 10-15 minutes to absorb the flavors before cooking.</p><h3 id=cooking-the-ribs-in-the-instant-pot>Cooking the Ribs in the Instant Pot</h3><p>Now that your ribs are prepped and seasoned, it&rsquo;s time to cook them in the Instant Pot. Here&rsquo;s the step-by-step guide:</p><h4 id=step-1-add-the-liquid>Step 1: Add the Liquid</h4><p>Pour 1 cup of chicken broth and 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar into the bottom of the Instant Pot. These liquids help create the steam needed for pressure cooking and ensure the ribs stay juicy and tender.</p><h4 id=step-2-insert-the-trivet>Step 2: Insert the Trivet</h4><p>Place the trivet into the Instant Pot over the liquid. The trivet keeps the ribs elevated above the liquid, so they cook evenly without sitting in the broth.</p><h4 id=step-3-add-the-ribs>Step 3: Add the Ribs</h4><p>Arrange the ribs on top of the trivet. You may need to curl them slightly to fit them into the Instant Pot, but make sure they’re in a single layer if possible. Avoid stacking them too much, as this can affect the cooking process.</p><h4 id=step-4-set-the-instant-pot>Step 4: Set the Instant Pot</h4><p>Close the Instant Pot lid and set the valve to &ldquo;Sealing.&rdquo; Choose the &ldquo;Pressure Cook&rdquo; or &ldquo;Manual&rdquo; setting and cook the ribs for 25-30 minutes on high pressure. The exact time depends on the thickness of the ribs and whether you&rsquo;re using baby back or spare ribs. Baby back ribs will cook a bit faster, while spare ribs might need the full 30 minutes.</p><h4 id=step-5-natural-pressure-release>Step 5: Natural Pressure Release</h4><p>Once the cooking time is complete, allow the Instant Pot to release pressure naturally for 10 minutes. After that, carefully move the valve to &ldquo;Venting&rdquo; to release any remaining pressure. This ensures the ribs stay moist and tender.</p><h3 id=finishing-the-ribs-broil-or-grill-for-a-perfect-glaze>Finishing the Ribs: Broil or Grill for a Perfect Glaze</h3><p>While your ribs are perfectly cooked in the Instant Pot, they still need a little time on the grill or under the broiler to caramelize the BBQ sauce and get that signature smoky, crispy finish. Here&rsquo;s how to do it:</p><h4 id=step-1-preheat-the-broiler-or-grill>Step 1: Preheat the Broiler or Grill</h4><p>If you’re using the broiler, preheat your oven to high broil. If grilling, preheat your grill to medium-high heat. The goal here is to apply the BBQ sauce and give the ribs a quick caramelization, without overcooking them.</p><h4 id=step-2-apply-the-bbq-sauce>Step 2: Apply the BBQ Sauce</h4><p>Once the ribs are out of the Instant Pot, brush a generous layer of your favorite BBQ sauce on both sides of the ribs. Make sure to coat them evenly, allowing the sauce to form a nice glaze as it cooks.</p><h4 id=step-3-broil-or-grill-the-ribs>Step 3: Broil or Grill the Ribs</h4><ul><li><strong>Under the Broiler</strong>: Place the ribs on a baking sheet lined with foil and broil them for about 5-7 minutes, turning halfway through. Watch carefully to avoid burning the sauce.</li><li><strong>On the Grill</strong>: Place the ribs on the grill, meat side down, and cook for 5-7 minutes on each side, basting with additional BBQ sauce as desired. This will give them a beautiful char while keeping them moist inside.</li></ul><h3 id=tips-for-the-best-instant-pot-bbq-ribs>Tips for the Best Instant Pot BBQ Ribs</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Don’t Skip the Liquid</strong>: The liquid in the Instant Pot is essential for creating steam and keeping the ribs moist. Make sure you use both the chicken broth and apple cider vinegar to add flavor and tenderness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resting Time is Key</strong>: Let the ribs rest for a few minutes after cooking to allow the juices to redistribute. This will make them even more tender and flavorful.</p></li><li><p><strong>Experiment with Flavors</strong>: Feel free to customize the dry rub and BBQ sauce based on your taste preferences. Add a little cayenne for heat, or swap out the brown sugar for honey for a different level of sweetness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use the Leftover Juices</strong>: Don’t discard the liquid left in the Instant Pot! It can be used as a flavorful base for sauces, soups, or even for basting future batches of ribs.</p></li></ol><h3 id=why-instant-pot-bbq-ribs-are-a-game-changer>Why Instant Pot BBQ Ribs are a Game Changer</h3><p>The Instant Pot allows you to make ribs that are so tender, they practically fall off the bone with each bite.
