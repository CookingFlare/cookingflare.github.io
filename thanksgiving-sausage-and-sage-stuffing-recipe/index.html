Among the spread of roasted meats, mashed potatoes, and cranberry sauce, there’s one dish that holds a special place in the hearts of many: stuffing. This Thanksgiving, elevate your stuffing game with a rich, savory Sausage and Sage Stuffing recipe that will have everyone at the table coming back for seconds.</p><p>Whether you&rsquo;re a stuffing purist or looking to try something new, this recipe combines traditional ingredients with a twist of hearty sausage and fragrant sage. It’s the perfect side dish to complement your turkey, and it’s sure to become a Thanksgiving favorite for years to come.</p><h2 id=ingredients>Ingredients</h2><p>Before diving into the steps, let’s gather the ingredients that will come together to create this flavorful stuffing. You&rsquo;ll need:</p><ul><li><strong>1 loaf of crusty bread</strong> (about 12 cups of cubed bread, preferably a day or two old, for the best texture)</li><li><strong>1 lb. Italian sausage</strong> (mild or spicy, depending on your preference)</li><li><strong>1 medium onion</strong>, diced</li><li><strong>3 celery stalks</strong>, diced</li><li><strong>3 cloves garlic</strong>, minced</li><li><strong>1/4 cup unsalted butter</strong></li><li><strong>2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</strong> (or vegetable broth for a vegetarian option)</li><li><strong>2 tsp. fresh sage</strong>, finely chopped (or 1 tsp. dried sage)</li><li><strong>1 tsp. thyme leaves</strong> (fresh or dried)</li><li><strong>1/2 tsp. salt</strong>, to taste</li><li><strong>1/2 tsp. black pepper</strong>, to taste</li><li><strong>1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes</strong> (optional, for a little heat)</li><li><strong>2 large eggs</strong></li><li><strong>1/2 cup fresh parsley</strong>, chopped (for garnish)</li><li><strong>1 tbsp. olive oil</strong></li></ul><h2 id=step-by-step-guide-to-making-sausage-and-sage-stuffing>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Sausage and Sage Stuffing</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-bread>Step 1: Prepare the Bread</h3><p>The foundation of any great stuffing is the bread. Choose a sturdy loaf that can absorb the flavors and moisture from the sausage and herbs. A rustic white or sourdough bread works wonderfully for this recipe.</p><p>Start by cutting the loaf into small cubes (about 1/2 inch each) and spread them out in a single layer on a baking sheet. Toast the cubes in a preheated oven at 300°F (150°C) for about 10-15 minutes, tossing halfway through to ensure they become golden and slightly crispy. This step will help them hold their shape and texture when they soak up the savory liquids later. Once done, set the toasted bread aside.</p><h3 id=step-2-cook-the-sausage>Step 2: Cook the Sausage</h3><p>Next, it’s time to cook the sausage. In a large skillet, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the sausage, breaking it up with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Brown the sausage thoroughly, which should take about 8-10 minutes. Once the sausage is fully cooked and browned, transfer it to a plate and set it aside.</p><p>Leave the rendered fat in the skillet – this will add even more flavor to your stuffing.</p><h3 id=step-3-sauté-the-aromatics>Step 3: Sauté the Aromatics</h3><p>In the same skillet, add the butter, and once it’s melted, toss in the diced onion and celery. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables have softened and the onion turns translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute, allowing the garlic to become fragrant. The combination of onion, celery, and garlic is the perfect aromatic base for your stuffing.</p><h3 id=step-4-combine-the-ingredients>Step 4: Combine the Ingredients</h3><p>Once the vegetables are soft and aromatic, it&rsquo;s time to combine everything. Add the cooked sausage back into the skillet, along with the fresh sage, thyme, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes (if using). Stir everything together to evenly distribute the seasonings and allow the sausage to mingle with the vegetables.</p><p>Now, add the sausage mixture to the toasted bread cubes in a large mixing bowl. Toss the bread and sausage mixture together until it’s well combined.</p><h3 id=step-5-add-the-liquids>Step 5: Add the Liquids</h3><p>Pour in the chicken broth and stir to moisten the bread cubes. The bread should absorb the broth, but if you prefer a more moist stuffing, feel free to add a little extra broth. The goal is to make sure the bread soaks up enough liquid to be tender but not soggy.</p><p>Next, crack the two eggs into the bowl and whisk them lightly before adding them to the mixture. The eggs will help bind everything together and give your stuffing the perfect texture. Stir until everything is evenly coated and the bread is adequately moistened.</p><h3 id=step-6-bake-the-stuffing>Step 6: Bake the Stuffing</h3><p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) if you haven’t done so already. Transfer the stuffing mixture into a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread it out in an even layer. At this point, you can cover the baking dish with aluminum foil to help retain moisture during baking.</p><p>Bake the stuffing for 25-30 minutes with the foil on. After that, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, allowing the top to become golden and crispy.</p><h3 id=step-7-garnish-and-serve>Step 7: Garnish and Serve</h3><p>Once the stuffing is baked to perfection, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving. Just before serving, sprinkle the chopped fresh parsley on top for a burst of color and fresh flavor.</p><h3 id=variations-and-tips-for-the-perfect-sausage-and-sage-stuffing>Variations and Tips for the Perfect Sausage and Sage Stuffing</h3><p>While this recipe is a classic, there are several ways to make it your own. Here are a few variations to try:</p><h4 id=add-dried-fruit-and-nuts>Add Dried Fruit and Nuts</h4><p>For an extra layer of flavor and texture, consider adding dried cranberries, raisins, or chopped apples to the stuffing. Toasted pecans, walnuts, or hazelnuts can add a delightful crunch and richness to the dish. These additions also bring a lovely contrast to the savory sausage and sage.</p><h4 id=use-different-sausage-flavors>Use Different Sausage Flavors</h4><p>This recipe calls for Italian sausage, but feel free to experiment with other types. A breakfast sausage or even a spicy chorizo would offer a different flavor profile. Just make sure to adjust the seasonings accordingly based on the sausage&rsquo;s flavor intensity.</p><h4 id=make-it-gluten-free>Make It Gluten-Free</h4><p>If you&rsquo;re serving guests with gluten sensitivities, you can easily make this stuffing gluten-free by swapping the bread for a gluten-free loaf. There are many excellent gluten-free breads available now that will still hold up well in stuffing.</p><h4 id=slow-cooker-version>Slow Cooker Version</h4><p>If you’re looking to save some oven space, consider making this stuffing in a slow cooker. Simply follow the recipe up to the point of combining all the ingredients, then transfer the mixture to a greased slow cooker. Cook on low for about 4-5 hours, or until the stuffing is hot and golden on top. This method allows you to free up your oven for other dishes while still enjoying a delicious stuffing.</p><h3 id=why-this-sausage-and-sage-stuffing-is-perfect-for-thanksgiving>Why This Sausage and Sage Stuffing Is Perfect for Thanksgiving</h3><p>The combination of sausage and sage in this stuffing recipe is nothing short of a match made in heaven. The rich, savory sausage adds depth and heartiness to the stuffing, while the sage provides a fragrant, earthy flavor that’s quintessentially autumnal. Together, these two ingredients create a stuffing that’s perfectly balanced and utterly satisfying.</p><p>This recipe also strikes the perfect balance between a moist stuffing and a crispy top. The toasty bread provides texture, while the sausage and broth make each bite flavorful and comforting. It’s the ideal side dish to pair with your Thanksgiving turkey, offering a flavorful contrast to the meat while complementing its rich, roasted flavors.</p><h3 id=storing-and-reheating-leftover-stuffing>Storing and Reheating Leftover Stuffing</h3><p>If you happen to have leftovers (which is often the case with a dish as delicious as this!), storing and reheating the stuffing is simple. Allow the stuffing to cool completely, then transfer it to an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days.</p><p>To reheat, cover the stuffing with aluminum foil and bake it in a 350°F (175°C) oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until it’s heated through. You can also add a little more broth to keep it moist if it seems dry.</p><h3 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h3><p>This Thanksgiving Sausage and Sage Stuffing is more than just a side dish – it’s a showstopper that will have your guests asking for the recipe. The savory sausage, fragrant herbs, and perfectly toasted bread come together to create a dish that’s as comforting as it is flavorful. Whether you&rsquo;re serving a small family gathering or a large feast, this stuffing recipe is sure to impress and become a beloved tradition in your holiday celebrations.</p><p>So, go ahead and try it this year, and don’t forget to savor every bite of this delicious stuffing that will leave your guests filled with gratitude and full of joy.
