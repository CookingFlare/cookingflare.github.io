In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, egg, minced garlic, chopped parsley, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Use your hands to mix everything together until well combined. Be careful not to overwork the mixture to keep the meatballs tender.</p><p>Once the mixture is ready, use your hands to shape it into small meatballs, about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. You should end up with around 20-24 meatballs, depending on the size.</p><h3 id=step-2-brown-the-meatballs>Step 2: Brown the Meatballs</h3><p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the meatballs in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pot. Brown the meatballs on all sides for about 5 minutes. The goal is to get a nice sear on the outside while keeping the inside tender. Once the meatballs are browned, remove them from the pot and set them aside. You don’t need to cook them all the way through at this point because they will finish cooking in the soup.</p><h3 id=step-3-sauté-the-vegetables>Step 3: Sauté the Vegetables</h3><p>In the same pot, add another tablespoon of olive oil and heat it over medium heat. Add the diced onion, carrots, celery, and zucchini. Sauté for about 5-7 minutes until the vegetables begin to soften and the onion becomes translucent. This step will release their natural sweetness and deepen the flavors of the soup.</p><p>Add the minced garlic to the vegetables and cook for another minute until fragrant.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-the-broth-and-tomatoes>Step 4: Add the Broth and Tomatoes</h3><p>Pour in the beef or chicken broth and add the can of diced tomatoes (with their juices) to the pot. Stir everything together to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p><h3 id=step-5-return-the-meatballs-to-the-pot>Step 5: Return the Meatballs to the Pot</h3><p>Once the broth is simmering, gently add the browned meatballs back into the pot. Stir carefully to make sure the meatballs are submerged in the broth. Add the bay leaf, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</p><h3 id=step-6-simmer-the-soup>Step 6: Simmer the Soup</h3><p>Let the soup simmer uncovered for 20-25 minutes, or until the meatballs are fully cooked through and the vegetables are tender. The meatballs should reach an internal temperature of 160°F (71°C). The flavors will continue to develop as the soup simmers, and the broth will become rich and flavorful.</p><h3 id=step-7-final-adjustments>Step 7: Final Adjustments</h3><p>Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning if necessary. You can add more salt, pepper, or herbs to suit your preference. If you like a bit of extra flavor, consider adding a pinch of dried thyme or rosemary.</p><h3 id=step-8-serve-and-garnish>Step 8: Serve and Garnish</h3><p>Ladle the soup into bowls, making sure to include a few meatballs and plenty of vegetables in each serving. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley or your favorite herbs for a pop of color and extra flavor.</p><p>Serve with a side of crusty bread for dipping, and enjoy the comforting warmth of this delicious homemade meatball soup.</p><h2 id=tips-for-making-the-best-meatball-soup>Tips for Making the Best Meatball Soup</h2><h3 id=1-use-lean-meat-for-healthier-meatballs>1. <strong>Use Lean Meat for Healthier Meatballs</strong></h3><p>While ground beef adds great flavor, you can opt for leaner meats like ground turkey or chicken for a healthier version of this meatball soup. These meats still provide plenty of flavor without the extra fat, making this soup a lighter option without sacrificing taste.</p><h3 id=2-customize-the-vegetables>2. <strong>Customize the Vegetables</strong></h3><p>Feel free to add or swap vegetables based on what you have available. Kale, spinach, or even potatoes would work wonderfully in this soup. The more vegetables you add, the more nutritious and filling the soup becomes.</p><h3 id=3-make-it-ahead-of-time>3. <strong>Make It Ahead of Time</strong></h3><p>This meatball soup tastes even better the next day as the flavors continue to develop. If you want to prepare it in advance, you can make the soup and store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. To reheat, simply simmer on the stove until it’s heated through.</p><h3 id=4-freeze-for-later>4. <strong>Freeze for Later</strong></h3><p>This recipe freezes beautifully. If you want to make a big batch to enjoy later, allow the soup to cool completely and transfer it to an airtight container. It can be stored in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, thaw overnight in the refrigerator and heat on the stove until warmed through.</p><h3 id=5-add-pasta-or-rice>5. <strong>Add Pasta or Rice</strong></h3><p>For a more hearty meal, you can add cooked pasta or rice to the soup. Simply cook the pasta or rice separately and add it to the soup just before serving. This will add extra texture and make the soup even more filling.</p><h2 id=pairing-suggestions>Pairing Suggestions</h2><h3 id=1-crusty-bread>1. <strong>Crusty Bread</strong></h3><p>A slice of toasted crusty bread or a fresh baguette pairs wonderfully with this meatball soup. The bread is perfect for dipping in the rich broth, making every bite more satisfying.</p><h3 id=2-green-salad>2. <strong>Green Salad</strong></h3><p>A simple green salad with a light vinaigrette is a great accompaniment to balance the hearty meatball soup. The freshness of the salad contrasts beautifully with the savory soup.</p><h3 id=3-cheese>3. <strong>Cheese</strong></h3><p>Top your bowl of meatball soup with freshly grated Parmesan or a sprinkle of mozzarella for an extra cheesy twist. The cheese melts into the soup, adding an extra layer of richness.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>This easy meatball soup recipe is sure to become a family favorite.

Whether you&rsquo;re making it for a weeknight dinner or preparing it ahead for later, this soup offers unbeatable flavor and convenience.
