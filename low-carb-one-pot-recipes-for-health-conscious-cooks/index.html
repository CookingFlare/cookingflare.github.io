Ingredients like herbs, spices, and fats infuse into the food, creating a rich, satisfying taste that’s hard to beat. One-pot meals are ideal for meal prep as they store well in the fridge, making them an excellent choice for leftovers.</p><h2 id=key-ingredients-for-low-carb-one-pot-recipes>Key Ingredients for Low-Carb One-Pot Recipes</h2><p>When crafting low-carb recipes, it&rsquo;s essential to focus on foods that are rich in protein, healthy fats, and fiber while avoiding or minimizing high-carb ingredients.
