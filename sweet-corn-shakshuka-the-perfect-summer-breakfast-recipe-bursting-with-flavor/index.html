If you’re using fresh sweet corn, carefully cut the kernels off the cob. You’ll need about 2 cups of corn, but feel free to adjust based on personal preference. If you’re using frozen corn, ensure it’s thawed before cooking.</p><p>Next, dice the onion and bell pepper, and mince the garlic. These vegetables will form the aromatic base of the shakshuka, so it’s important to get them prepped and ready.</p><h3 id=step-2-sauté-the-vegetables>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3><p>In a large skillet or a shallow, wide pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and bell pepper and sauté for 4-5 minutes, or until they soften and become translucent. Stir occasionally to prevent burning.</p><p>Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds, or until fragrant. Garlic adds an incredible depth of flavor to the dish, so make sure not to skip this step!</p><h3 id=step-3-spice-it-up>Step 3: Spice It Up</h3><p>Once the onions and bell peppers have softened, add the ground cumin, paprika, ground coriander, and turmeric to the skillet. Stir well to coat the vegetables with the spices and let them cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. The spices will release their oils, creating a rich, fragrant base for the shakshuka.</p><p>If you prefer a spicy kick, now is the time to add chili flakes. You can adjust the amount depending on how much heat you want in the dish.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-tomatoes-and-sweet-corn>Step 4: Add Tomatoes and Sweet Corn</h3><p>Add the diced tomatoes (with their juice) to the pan, along with the fresh or frozen sweet corn. Stir to combine and bring the mixture to a simmer. Allow it to cook for about 5-7 minutes, letting the flavors meld together and the corn become tender. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.</p><p>If you like a slightly thicker sauce, you can cook the mixture for a little longer, allowing it to reduce to your desired consistency. The natural sweetness of the corn will infuse the tomato sauce, creating a balanced and slightly sweet base.</p><h3 id=step-5-poach-the-eggs>Step 5: Poach the Eggs</h3><p>Once the sauce has simmered and the vegetables are tender, it’s time to add the eggs. Use a spoon to make small wells in the sauce, then gently crack the eggs into each well. Cover the pan with a lid and let the eggs poach for about 5-7 minutes, or until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny.</p><p>If you prefer your eggs more cooked, simply leave them on the heat for a couple of extra minutes. The beauty of shakshuka is that the eggs can be cooked to your liking, whether you enjoy runny yolks or fully set eggs.</p><h3 id=step-6-garnish-and-serve>Step 6: Garnish and Serve</h3><p>Once the eggs are cooked to perfection, remove the pan from the heat. Sprinkle crumbled feta cheese (if using) over the shakshuka for added creaminess, and finish with a generous sprinkle of fresh cilantro or parsley for a pop of color and freshness. Serve the Sweet Corn Shakshuka with lemon wedges on the side for a touch of brightness.</p><p>You can also drizzle a bit of fresh lime juice over the shakshuka for an extra zesty finish.</p><h3 id=step-7-enjoy>Step 7: Enjoy!</h3><p>Serve the Sweet Corn Shakshuka hot, either on its own or with a side of warm crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce. It’s the perfect dish to enjoy with a cup of coffee or a refreshing iced beverage on a warm summer morning.</p><h2 id=tips-for-making-the-perfect-sweet-corn-shakshuka>Tips for Making the Perfect Sweet Corn Shakshuka</h2><ul><li><strong>Choose fresh corn</strong>: During the summer months, fresh corn on the cob is the way to go. The sweetness and texture of fresh corn will elevate your shakshuka. However, if fresh corn isn’t available, frozen corn works just as well.</li><li><strong>Spice it up</strong>: Adjust the spices according to your personal taste. Add more paprika for smokiness, extra cumin for earthiness, or a dash of cayenne pepper for heat.</li><li><strong>Egg variations</strong>: While traditional shakshuka uses poached eggs, you can also try adding scrambled eggs or even soft-boiled eggs if you prefer.</li><li><strong>Vegan version</strong>: To make this recipe vegan, simply omit the eggs and feta.
