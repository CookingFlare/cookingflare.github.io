Whether it&rsquo;s a cozy weekend morning or a special holiday brunch, biscuits have a way of making everything feel more comforting and delicious. But what if you could enjoy these mouthwatering treats without any dairy or animal products? Enter vegan buttermilk biscuits, which are just as soft, flaky, and flavorful as their traditional counterparts — and without any butter or milk.</p><p>In this recipe, we’re going to explore how to make perfectly soft and flaky vegan buttermilk biscuits that will become your new favorite breakfast or side dish. With simple ingredients and easy steps, you’ll be able to create a batch of biscuits that are sure to impress anyone who takes a bite. Let’s dive in!</p><h2 id=the-key-ingredients-for-vegan-buttermilk-biscuits>The Key Ingredients for Vegan Buttermilk Biscuits</h2><p>Making the best vegan buttermilk biscuits begins with selecting the right ingredients. In this recipe, we’re going to replace traditional dairy and butter with plant-based options that retain all the delicious qualities of the original. Here’s what you’ll need:</p><h3 id=1-all-purpose-flour>1. <strong>All-Purpose Flour</strong></h3><p>All-purpose flour is the foundation of any biscuit recipe, and it provides the structure and texture that makes biscuits so tender. You can also experiment with a blend of flours like whole wheat or gluten-free options, but we recommend sticking with all-purpose flour for this recipe to ensure your biscuits come out light and flaky.</p><h3 id=2-baking-powder>2. <strong>Baking Powder</strong></h3><p>Baking powder is what gives these biscuits their rise. It’s a leavening agent that helps the dough expand, creating a light and fluffy texture. Make sure your baking powder is fresh for the best results.</p><h3 id=3-salt>3. <strong>Salt</strong></h3><p>A pinch of salt is essential to enhance the overall flavor of your biscuits. It balances the richness of the dough and brings out the flavors of the other ingredients.</p><h3 id=4-vegan-butter>4. <strong>Vegan Butter</strong></h3><p>In a traditional biscuit recipe, butter is what makes them flaky and rich. For our vegan version, we’ll be using vegan butter, which mimics the texture and flavor of dairy butter. Look for a high-quality, non-dairy butter, preferably one with a higher fat content to achieve that melt-in-your-mouth goodness.</p><h3 id=5-vegan-buttermilk>5. <strong>Vegan Buttermilk</strong></h3><p>The key to that signature &ldquo;buttermilk&rdquo; tang is a plant-based substitute for buttermilk. This can be made by adding a little vinegar or lemon juice to any plant-based milk (like almond, soy, or oat milk). When combined, the acidity of the vinegar or lemon juice helps curdle the plant milk and create a texture that closely mimics traditional buttermilk. It’s the perfect way to give your biscuits that tangy flavor.</p><h3 id=6-sugar-optional>6. <strong>Sugar (Optional)</strong></h3><p>While not strictly necessary, a touch of sugar can enhance the flavor of your biscuits and give them a slight sweetness. It also contributes to browning during baking. If you prefer savory biscuits, feel free to omit the sugar.</p><h3 id=7-cold-water-optional>7. <strong>Cold Water (Optional)</strong></h3><p>In some cases, you may need a small amount of cold water to bring the dough together. However, use this sparingly, as too much water can result in dense biscuits.</p><h2 id=how-to-make-vegan-buttermilk-biscuits>How to Make Vegan Buttermilk Biscuits</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-vegan-buttermilk>Step 1: Prepare the Vegan Buttermilk</h3><p>Start by making the vegan buttermilk. In a measuring cup, pour 1 cup of your preferred plant-based milk. Add 1 tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice to the milk, stirring it gently. Let this mixture sit for 5-10 minutes to allow the acid to react with the milk, thickening and curdling it slightly, giving it the tangy flavor of traditional buttermilk.</p><h3 id=step-2-combine-dry-ingredients>Step 2: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3><p>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar (if using). Make sure the ingredients are evenly distributed to avoid clumps and ensure that every bite of biscuit is consistently flavorful.</p><h3 id=step-3-cut-in-the-vegan-butter>Step 3: Cut in the Vegan Butter</h3><p>Next, add the cold vegan butter to your flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter, fork, or your fingers to cut the butter into the flour. You want to break it down into small, pea-sized pieces. This process is essential for creating the flaky layers in your biscuits. Don’t worry if the butter isn’t fully incorporated; small chunks of butter throughout the dough are what help achieve that signature flakiness.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-the-vegan-buttermilk>Step 4: Add the Vegan Buttermilk</h3><p>Once the butter is mixed in, it’s time to add the vegan buttermilk. Make a well in the center of your dry ingredients, and pour in the buttermilk mixture. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to gently fold the ingredients together. Be careful not to overmix; just stir until the dough begins to come together. It’s okay if the dough is a little shaggy or rough around the edges.</p><h3 id=step-5-knead-the-dough>Step 5: Knead the Dough</h3><p>Lightly flour your countertop or work surface. Turn the dough out onto the surface and gently knead it for about 1-2 minutes. The key here is not to overwork the dough. Knead it just enough to bring it together and form a cohesive ball. Overkneading will make your biscuits tough, so keep it gentle!</p><h3 id=step-6-roll-and-cut-the-biscuits>Step 6: Roll and Cut the Biscuits</h3><p>Once the dough has been kneaded, roll it out to about 1-inch thickness using a rolling pin. Try to handle the dough as little as possible to avoid making it dense. Use a biscuit cutter or a drinking glass (about 2-3 inches in diameter) to cut out circles of dough. Be sure to press straight down when cutting the biscuits—don’t twist the cutter, as this can seal the edges and prevent the biscuits from rising properly.</p><p>Gather any remaining dough scraps, gently press them back together, and cut out more biscuits until all the dough is used. You should be able to get about 8-10 biscuits, depending on the size of your cutter.</p><h3 id=step-7-bake-the-biscuits>Step 7: Bake the Biscuits</h3><p>Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Place your biscuits onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. For even more golden, flaky edges, you can brush the tops of the biscuits with a little melted vegan butter before baking. This step is optional but adds a nice touch of flavor.</p><p>Bake the biscuits in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until they’re golden brown and puffed up. The biscuits should have a crispy exterior, and when you break one open, it should be soft, fluffy, and slightly layered on the inside.</p><h3 id=step-8-serve-and-enjoy>Step 8: Serve and Enjoy!</h3><p>Once the biscuits are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for just a few minutes on the baking sheet. These vegan buttermilk biscuits are best enjoyed fresh out of the oven while they’re still warm. Serve them as a side to your favorite meals, slathered with dairy-free butter or jam, or use them to make a vegan biscuit sandwich with your favorite fillings.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-vegan-biscuits>Tips for Perfect Vegan Biscuits</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Use Cold Ingredients:</strong> Just like with traditional biscuits, cold butter and cold vegan buttermilk are essential to achieving the right texture. Cold fat creates pockets of air in the dough, which leads to those flaky layers. You can even chill your mixing bowl for extra precaution!</p></li><li><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t Overmix the Dough:</strong> Overmixing will make your biscuits dense instead of light and fluffy. Mix until the dough just comes together and stop there.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chill Your Dough:</strong> If you have time, refrigerate the dough for about 30 minutes before rolling it out. This will help the fat solidify, leading to even flakier biscuits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use a Sharp Biscuit Cutter:</strong> A sharp cutter will make clean cuts and allow the biscuits to rise more evenly. Avoid twisting the cutter when you press down—it can seal the edges and prevent the biscuits from rising properly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make Extra and Freeze Them:</strong> If you want to have biscuits ready at a moment’s notice, you can freeze the unbaked biscuits. After cutting the biscuits, place them on a baking sheet in the freezer. Once they’re frozen solid, transfer them to a freezer-safe bag or container. When you’re ready to bake, just add a few extra minutes to the baking time.</p></li></ol><h2 id=variations-and-add-ins>Variations and Add-ins</h2><p>Feel free to get creative with your vegan buttermilk biscuits. Here are a few ideas to customize them to your taste:</p><ul><li><strong>Cheese Biscuits:</strong> Add some vegan cheddar or mozzarella shreds to the dough for a cheesy twist.</li><li><strong>Herb Biscuits:</strong> Fold in fresh herbs like rosemary, thyme, or chives for an extra burst of flavor.</li><li><strong>Sweet Biscuits:</strong> Add a teaspoon of cinnamon or nutmeg to the dough for a sweet, spiced flavor. You can even fold in some dried fruit, like raisins or cranberries.</li><li><strong>Garlic Biscuits:</strong> For a savory option, mince a few cloves of garlic and fold them into the dough. You can also brush the biscuits with garlic butter before serving.</li></ul><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Vegan buttermilk biscuits are a delicious, plant-based alternative to the traditional recipe, and they’re just as flaky, soft, and flavorful as you’d expect.
