The dough is easy to work with, and assembling the layers is as enjoyable as it is delicious. Here&rsquo;s a detailed step-by-step guide to help you through the process.</p><h3 id=step-1-activate-the-yeast>Step 1: Activate the Yeast</h3><p>The first thing we need to do is activate the yeast. Start by heating the whole milk to about 110°F. It should feel warm to the touch but not hot. Pour the warm milk into a small bowl, then add 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar. Stir to dissolve. Sprinkle the active dry yeast over the milk and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy and bubbly. This means the yeast is activated and ready to go.</p><h3 id=step-2-make-the-dough>Step 2: Make the Dough</h3><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, the remaining sugar, and the salt. Whisk these dry ingredients together until they&rsquo;re well mixed. Create a well in the center of the flour mixture.</p><p>Once the yeast is activated, pour it into the well along with the melted butter and the egg. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir everything together until the dough starts to come together. Once the dough begins to form, transfer it to a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes. If the dough is too sticky, add a little more flour, but be careful not to add too much, as this can make the dough dense.</p><p>You want the dough to be smooth, elastic, and soft. After kneading, shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</p><h3 id=step-3-prepare-the-cinnamon-sugar-filling>Step 3: Prepare the Cinnamon Sugar Filling</h3><p>While the dough is rising, you can prepare the cinnamon-sugar filling. In a small bowl, combine the granulated sugar and cinnamon. Stir to combine evenly. This is the sweet and aromatic filling that will give the bread its signature flavor and texture.</p><h3 id=step-4-roll-out-the-dough>Step 4: Roll Out the Dough</h3><p>Once the dough has risen, punch it down gently to release any air bubbles. Transfer it to a lightly floured surface and roll it out into a rectangle, about 16 inches by 12 inches. Try to keep the edges straight, but don’t worry if it’s not perfect – this bread is forgiving!</p><p>Brush the rolled-out dough with the melted butter, making sure to cover the entire surface. Then, generously sprinkle the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the buttered dough, making sure the filling is evenly distributed across the entire surface. Be sure to go all the way to the edges of the dough.</p><h3 id=step-5-cut-and-stack-the-dough>Step 5: Cut and Stack the Dough</h3><p>Once the dough is coated with the cinnamon-sugar mixture, it’s time to cut it into strips. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the dough into 6 equal strips along the longer side of the rectangle. Then, carefully stack the strips on top of each other, creating a pile of cinnamon-sugar layers.</p><p>Now, slice the stacked dough into 6 equal portions, creating square pieces that will be stacked vertically in the pan. These stacked pieces will be the &ldquo;pull-apart&rdquo; parts of the bread that you’ll enjoy when the bread is baked.</p><h3 id=step-6-arrange-the-dough-in-the-pan>Step 6: Arrange the Dough in the Pan</h3><p>Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan and carefully arrange the dough squares in the pan, standing them up on their sides. The dough should fit snugly into the pan, and it’s okay if it’s a bit messy – it will come together during the rise and bake.</p><p>Cover the pan with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise for an additional 30 minutes to 1 hour, until it has puffed up and fills the pan.</p><h3 id=step-7-bake-the-bread>Step 7: Bake the Bread</h3><p>While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Once the dough has fully risen, place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes. The bread should be golden brown on top and a toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean.</p><p>During the last few minutes of baking, you can check the bread to ensure it’s not getting too dark. If the top is browning too quickly, you can loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil for the remainder of the baking time.</p><h3 id=step-8-cool-and-serve>Step 8: Cool and Serve</h3><p>Once your Sweet Cinnamon Sugar Pull-Apart Bread is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.</p><p>If you&rsquo;d like, you can dust the top of the bread with a light sprinkling of powdered sugar for a touch of sweetness and a beautiful finish. Slice and enjoy the sweet, fluffy layers as they pull apart effortlessly. Each piece is filled with the rich flavor of cinnamon and sugar, making it the perfect treat for any occasion.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-perfect-cinnamon-sugar-pull-apart-bread>Tips for the Perfect Cinnamon Sugar Pull-Apart Bread</h2><ul><li><strong>Use fresh yeast:</strong> Be sure your yeast is fresh and hasn’t expired, as this will ensure the dough rises properly and results in a soft, fluffy bread.</li><li><strong>Don’t rush the rising process:</strong> The dough needs time to rise and develop its texture. If you’re short on time, you can place the dough in a warm spot, like near a radiator or in an oven with the light on, to speed up the process slightly.</li><li><strong>Customize the filling:</strong> Feel free to experiment with the filling by adding chopped nuts, raisins, or even a drizzle of caramel sauce for an extra layer of flavor.</li><li><strong>Store leftovers properly:</strong> Store any leftover bread in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2-3 days. You can also freeze the bread for up to a month. Just wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and foil before freezing, and thaw it when you&rsquo;re ready to enjoy.</li></ul><h2 id=why-youll-love-this-cinnamon-sugar-pull-apart-bread>Why You&rsquo;ll Love This Cinnamon Sugar Pull-Apart Bread</h2><p>This Sweet Cinnamon Sugar Pull-Apart Bread is the perfect combination of flavors and textures.
