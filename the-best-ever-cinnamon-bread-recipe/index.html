Whether you are looking for a delicious breakfast treat, a cozy snack, or something to serve at a special occasion, cinnamon bread is the answer. This recipe will guide you step-by-step to create a loaf of cinnamon bread that’s so good, you’ll want to make it every week.</p><h2 id=ingredients-for-cinnamon-bread>Ingredients for Cinnamon Bread</h2><p>Before you start baking, gather the following ingredients to make your cinnamon bread:</p><h3 id=for-the-dough>For the Dough:</h3><ul><li><strong>3 cups all-purpose flour</strong></li><li><strong>1 packet active dry yeast</strong> (2 1/4 teaspoons)</li><li><strong>1/2 cup warm milk</strong> (110°F)</li><li><strong>1/4 cup sugar</strong></li><li><strong>1/4 cup unsalted butter</strong>, melted</li><li><strong>2 large eggs</strong></li><li><strong>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</strong></li><li><strong>1 teaspoon salt</strong></li></ul><h3 id=for-the-cinnamon-swirl>For the Cinnamon Swirl:</h3><ul><li><strong>1/2 cup brown sugar</strong> (packed)</li><li><strong>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</strong></li><li><strong>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</strong>, melted</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-glaze>For the Glaze:</h3><ul><li><strong>1/2 cup powdered sugar</strong></li><li><strong>2 tablespoons milk</strong></li><li><strong>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</strong></li></ul><p>These ingredients are simple and easy to find, but they come together to create a bread that’s nothing short of extraordinary. The key to success in this recipe is taking your time and allowing the dough to rise properly, which leads to a soft, airy texture that you’ll fall in love with.</p><h2 id=step-by-step-instructions-for-cinnamon-bread>Step-by-Step Instructions for Cinnamon Bread</h2><h3 id=step-1-activate-the-yeast>Step 1: Activate the Yeast</h3><p>Start by activating your yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm milk and sugar. Sprinkle the active dry yeast over the top, stirring gently to dissolve. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. If the yeast doesn’t foam up, it may be expired, and you will need to use a new packet.</p><h3 id=step-2-prepare-the-dough>Step 2: Prepare the Dough</h3><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the activated yeast mixture, along with the melted butter, eggs, and vanilla extract. Use a wooden spoon to mix everything together until a dough begins to form.</p><p>Next, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. If the dough is too sticky, sprinkle a little more flour, but be careful not to add too much as this could make the bread dense.</p><h3 id=step-3-let-the-dough-rise>Step 3: Let the Dough Rise</h3><p>Once the dough is kneaded, shape it into a ball and place it in a lightly greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until it doubles in size. You can speed up this process by placing the bowl in an oven that’s been warmed to 200°F for just a few minutes and then turned off.</p><h3 id=step-4-make-the-cinnamon-sugar-filling>Step 4: Make the Cinnamon Sugar Filling</h3><p>While the dough is rising, prepare the cinnamon filling. In a small bowl, mix together the brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and melted butter. Stir until everything is well combined, and set aside.</p><h3 id=step-5-roll-out-the-dough>Step 5: Roll Out the Dough</h3><p>Once your dough has doubled in size, punch it down to release the air. Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll it out into a large rectangle, about 12x18 inches. Make sure the dough is even, as this will help the cinnamon swirl look beautiful and consistent throughout.</p><h3 id=step-6-add-the-cinnamon-filling>Step 6: Add the Cinnamon Filling</h3><p>Spread the cinnamon sugar mixture evenly over the rolled-out dough, leaving a small border around the edges. This will ensure that the filling doesn’t spill out when you roll the dough. Be generous with the filling because it’s what gives the bread that irresistible flavor.</p><h3 id=step-7-roll-the-dough-and-shape-the-loaf>Step 7: Roll the Dough and Shape the Loaf</h3><p>Once the filling is spread evenly, carefully roll the dough up from one of the long edges into a tight log. Pinch the seam together at the end to seal it. Next, gently twist the dough into a spiral shape and tuck the ends under, forming a loaf. This will help the bread keep its shape during baking.</p><h3 id=step-8-let-the-dough-rise-again>Step 8: Let the Dough Rise Again</h3><p>Place the shaped dough into a greased 9x5-inch loaf pan. Cover it with a kitchen towel and allow it to rise for another 30-45 minutes, or until it has puffed up and risen slightly above the edge of the pan. During this time, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</p><h3 id=step-9-bake-the-cinnamon-bread>Step 9: Bake the Cinnamon Bread</h3><p>Once the dough has finished its second rise, place the loaf in the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Keep an eye on the bread as it bakes to prevent it from becoming too dark. If it’s browning too quickly, cover the top loosely with foil.</p><h3 id=step-10-prepare-the-glaze>Step 10: Prepare the Glaze</h3><p>While the bread is baking, prepare the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth. The glaze should be thick enough to drizzle but not too runny.</p><h3 id=step-11-glaze-the-cinnamon-bread>Step 11: Glaze the Cinnamon Bread</h3><p>Once your cinnamon bread has finished baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer it to a wire rack to cool slightly before glazing. Drizzle the glaze over the top of the warm bread, allowing it to soak in for extra sweetness.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-cinnamon-bread>Tips for Perfect Cinnamon Bread</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Use room temperature ingredients:</strong> Having your eggs, butter, and milk at room temperature will help the dough come together more easily and rise better.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t rush the rising process:</strong> Allowing the dough to rise fully is crucial for creating a soft and airy texture. It can be tempting to rush, but giving the dough time to rise will pay off in the final result.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customize the filling:</strong> While brown sugar and cinnamon are the classic filling for this bread, you can add chopped nuts (like walnuts or pecans), raisins, or even a bit of cocoa powder for a twist on the traditional recipe.</p></li><li><p><strong>Store properly:</strong> To keep your cinnamon bread fresh for longer, store it in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days. If you want to keep it longer, you can freeze it for up to 3 months. Just wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and foil before freezing.</p></li></ul><h2 id=why-this-cinnamon-bread-is-the-best>Why This Cinnamon Bread is the Best</h2><p>What makes this cinnamon bread stand out from the crowd is its perfect balance of flavor and texture.
