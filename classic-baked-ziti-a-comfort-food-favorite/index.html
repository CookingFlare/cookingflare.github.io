This hearty casserole is loaded with perfectly cooked pasta, a rich and savory tomato sauce, gooey melted cheese, and a touch of seasoning that ties everything together. Whether you&rsquo;re feeding a crowd, meal prepping for the week, or simply craving a comforting dish that feels like a warm hug, baked ziti is always a crowd-pleaser.</p><p>In this recipe, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the steps to make a classic baked ziti that everyone will love. From the choice of pasta to the flavors that bring everything together, we&rsquo;ll cover it all, ensuring you end up with a dish that’s both delicious and easy to prepare.</p><h3 id=what-is-baked-ziti>What is Baked Ziti?</h3><p>Baked ziti is a beloved pasta casserole that originated in Italy and found its way into homes across America, becoming a staple at family dinners, potlucks, and holiday feasts. The dish typically consists of ziti pasta (or a similar tubular pasta), combined with a tomato-based marinara sauce, ricotta cheese, and mozzarella cheese. After assembling the ingredients, the dish is baked in the oven until bubbly and golden brown, creating layers of flavor that are hard to resist.</p><h3 id=why-baked-ziti-is-a-comfort-food-favorite>Why Baked Ziti is a Comfort Food Favorite</h3><p>There’s something undeniably satisfying about baked ziti. It brings together familiar flavors in a way that feels both nostalgic and indulgent. The warm, cheesy goodness paired with the rich tomato sauce creates the ultimate comfort food experience, making it perfect for cozy dinners at home or when you want to feed a crowd without spending hours in the kitchen.</p><p>Additionally, baked ziti is incredibly versatile. You can customize it with different ingredients to suit your preferences, from adding vegetables like spinach or mushrooms to incorporating ground beef, sausage, or even chicken. You can also make it vegetarian or adjust the cheese blend to your liking. No matter how you make it, baked ziti is always delicious and comforting.</p><h3 id=the-best-pasta-for-baked-ziti>The Best Pasta for Baked Ziti</h3><p>While you might think of any tubular pasta as suitable for baked ziti, the traditional choice is ziti. Ziti is a medium-sized pasta with a smooth texture and hollow interior that perfectly holds onto the sauce. However, if you can&rsquo;t find ziti, penne pasta is an excellent substitute. Penne has a similar shape, with its ridges helping the sauce adhere to the pasta.</p><p>Regardless of the type of pasta you choose, it’s important to cook it al dente. This ensures the pasta holds its shape during baking and doesn’t become too soft or mushy. Undercooking the pasta by a minute or two is a good practice since the pasta will continue to cook while it bakes in the sauce.</p><h3 id=ingredients-for-classic-baked-ziti>Ingredients for Classic Baked Ziti</h3><p>To make a classic baked ziti, you don’t need many ingredients. Below is a simple list of what you’ll need to create this delicious dish.</p><h4 id=for-the-ziti>For the Ziti:</h4><ul><li>1 pound ziti pasta (or penne)</li><li>Salt for boiling water</li></ul><h4 id=for-the-sauce>For the Sauce:</h4><ul><li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li><li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li><li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li><li>1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste</li><li>1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce</li><li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li><li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li><li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional for a bit of heat)</li><li>Salt and pepper to taste</li><li>1 tablespoon sugar (to balance acidity, optional)</li></ul><h4 id=for-the-cheese>For the Cheese:</h4><ul><li>1 (15-ounce) container ricotta cheese</li><li>1 large egg</li><li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li><li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li><li>Fresh basil or parsley for garnish (optional)</li></ul><h3 id=how-to-make-classic-baked-ziti>How to Make Classic Baked Ziti</h3><p>Now that you have all the ingredients ready, it’s time to get cooking! Follow these simple steps to make the perfect baked ziti that everyone will love.</p><h4 id=step-1-preheat-your-oven>Step 1: Preheat Your Oven</h4><p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This ensures the oven is hot enough to bake the ziti until golden and bubbly.</p><h4 id=step-2-cook-the-ziti-pasta>Step 2: Cook the Ziti Pasta</h4><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, add the ziti (or penne) pasta and cook according to the package instructions, but subtract one or two minutes from the suggested cooking time. You want the pasta to be just undercooked (al dente) since it will continue to cook in the oven later. Drain the pasta and set it aside.</p><h4 id=step-3-prepare-the-tomato-sauce>Step 3: Prepare the Tomato Sauce</h4><p>While the pasta is cooking, you can start on the tomato sauce. In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until softened. Add the garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.</p><p>Next, stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato sauce. Add the dried basil, oregano, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper. Stir everything together and bring the sauce to a simmer. Let it cook for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld together. If the sauce is too acidic, you can add a tablespoon of sugar to balance it out.</p><p>Once the sauce is done, remove it from the heat.</p><h4 id=step-4-prepare-the-cheese-mixture>Step 4: Prepare the Cheese Mixture</h4><p>In a large bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and half of the shredded mozzarella cheese. Add a pinch of salt and pepper to taste. Mix everything together until smooth and well combined.</p><h4 id=step-5-assemble-the-baked-ziti>Step 5: Assemble the Baked Ziti</h4><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta with the tomato sauce, making sure the pasta is evenly coated with the sauce. If you want to make the ziti extra cheesy, you can reserve a bit of mozzarella cheese to sprinkle on top during the baking process.</p><p>Next, add about half of the pasta and sauce mixture to a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Spoon the ricotta mixture on top, spreading it evenly. Then, add the remaining pasta and sauce mixture on top of the ricotta layer. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese over the top.</p><h4 id=step-6-bake-the-ziti>Step 6: Bake the Ziti</h4><p>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top is golden and the cheese is bubbling. You can even broil the top for a few minutes if you want a crispy, golden crust.</p><h4 id=step-7-garnish-and-serve>Step 7: Garnish and Serve</h4><p>Once your baked ziti is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. Garnish with freshly chopped basil or parsley if desired. Serve the baked ziti hot and enjoy!</p><h3 id=tips-for-perfect-baked-ziti>Tips for Perfect Baked Ziti</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Make-Ahead Option:</strong> You can prepare the baked ziti in advance and store it in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours before baking. Simply assemble the dish, cover it tightly with foil, and refrigerate. When you&rsquo;re ready to bake, remove the foil and bake as directed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Freezing Baked Ziti:</strong> Baked ziti also freezes well. If you want to make a batch for later, assemble the dish and freeze it before baking. To cook from frozen, bake at 375°F (190°C) for 45-60 minutes, or until the ziti is hot and bubbly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customizing Your Ziti:</strong> Feel free to add vegetables like sautéed mushrooms, spinach, or bell peppers to the sauce for extra flavor and nutrition. You can also add ground beef, Italian sausage, or chicken for a meatier version of the dish.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cheese Variations:</strong> While mozzarella and ricotta are the traditional choices, feel free to experiment with other cheeses like provolone, fontina, or even a sprinkle of gouda for a different flavor profile.</p></li></ul><h3 id=why-youll-love-this-classic-baked-ziti>Why You’ll Love This Classic Baked Ziti</h3><p>Classic baked ziti is more than just a meal – it&rsquo;s a celebration of comforting flavors that bring people together.
