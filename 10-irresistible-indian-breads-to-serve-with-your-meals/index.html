From crispy unleavened flatbreads to soft, fluffy leavened breads, there's an Indian bread to complement every meal. Whether you're in the mood for something savory or sweet, crunchy or chewy, we've got you covered with these 10 irresistible Indian bread recipes to elevate your meals.</p><ol><li>Naan
Naan, a staple in Indian households, is a type of leavened flatbread originating from the Indian subcontinent. This soft, lightly leavened bread is made with flour, water, yeast, salt, sugar, and ghee. To make naan at home, start by combining warm milk, yeast, and sugar in a bowl. Let the mixture sit for 5-7 minutes until it froths, then mix it with the remaining ingredients and knead for 10-15 minutes until smooth. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours until doubled in size. Preheat a non-stick skillet or tava and cook the naan for 1-2 minutes on each side until it puffs up.</li><li>Roti
Roti, another classic Indian flatbread, is made from whole wheat flour. Unlike naan, roti is unleavened, which means it doesn't contain yeast or any other leavening agents. This simple and crunchy flatbread is usually cooked on a preheated tava or skillet. Start by kneading 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of oil in a bowl. Gradually add warm water to form a soft dough, then knead for 5-7 minutes. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions, shape into balls, and flatten each into a thin circle. Cook the roti on a hot tava for 30-60 seconds on each side until it's evenly cooked and puffed.</li><li>Paratha
A rich and flaky Indian flatbread, paratha is a perfect accompaniment to spicy curries. This layered flatbread, made from a mixture of all-purpose flour and coarse wheat flour, is a delight to the senses. To make paratha, combine 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 cup of coarse wheat flour, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1 tablespoon of oil in a bowl. Add warm water to form a smooth dough, and knead for 10-15 minutes until elastic. Divide the dough into 8 portions, roll out each into a thin circle, and fold it into a triangle. Deep-fry the paratha in hot oil until golden brown, then drain on paper towels and cook on a tava for a few more minutes.</li><li>Chapati
Chapati, another popular type of unleavened flatbread, is a staple in Indian cuisine. Made from wheat flour, water, and a pinch of salt, this simple and delicious bread is perfect for serving with a variety of curries, soups, and sauces. To make chapati, combine 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1 tablespoon of oil in a bowl. Gradually add warm water to form a soft dough, then knead for 10-15 minutes until smooth. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions, roll out each into a thin circle, and cook on a preheated tava or skillet for 30-60 seconds on each side.</li><li>Garlic Naan
A flavorful twist on the traditional naan, garlic naan is a must-try for garlic enthusiasts. Flavored with minced garlic and coriander, this variant is sure to add an extra kick to your meals. Start by combining warm milk, yeast, and sugar in a bowl. After 5-7 minutes, mix in the remaining ingredients, including minced garlic and coriander, and knead for 10-15 minutes. Let the dough rise for 1-2 hours, then divide it into 8 portions and shape into balls. Flatten each ball into a thin circle and cook in a preheated tava or skillet for 1-2 minutes on each side.</li><li>Butter Naan
For a luxurious twist on traditional naan, try butter naan. This rich and indulgent flatbread is perfect for serving with hearty curries and kebabs. To make butter naan, combine warm milk, yeast, and sugar in a bowl. Let the mixture sit for 5-7 minutes until frothy, then mix in the remaining ingredients, including melted butter, and knead for 10-15 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours until doubled in size. Preheat a non-stick skillet or tava and cook the naan for 1-2 minutes on each side until puffed up.</li><li>Laccha Paratha

To make laccha paratha, combine 2 cups of all-purpose flour, 1 cup of coarse wheat flour, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1 tablespoon of oil in a bowl.
