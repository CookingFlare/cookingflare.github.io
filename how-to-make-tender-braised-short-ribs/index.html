Follow this comprehensive recipe for perfectly tender braised short ribs that will leave everyone asking for seconds.</p><h2 id=ingredients-youll-need>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2><p>Before we dive into the method, ensure you have all the necessary ingredients. Braising short ribs is a method that thrives on layering flavors, so each element plays an essential role in achieving a deeply savory and satisfying dish.</p><h3 id=for-the-short-ribs>For the Short Ribs</h3><ul><li>4–6 bone-in beef short ribs, about 2 pounds</li><li>Kosher salt</li><li>Freshly ground black pepper</li><li>3–4 tablespoons all-purpose flour (optional)</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-braising-base>For the Braising Base</h3><ul><li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li><li>1 large yellow onion, diced</li><li>2 medium carrots, peeled and chopped</li><li>2 celery stalks, chopped</li><li>4–5 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>2 cups dry red wine (like Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot)</li><li>2 cups beef stock (preferably low-sodium)</li><li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li><li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li><li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li><li>2 bay leaves</li><li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li><li>Optional: 1–2 teaspoons smoked paprika or cayenne pepper for subtle heat</li></ul><h3 id=for-garnish-and-serving>For Garnish and Serving</h3><ul><li>Fresh parsley, finely chopped</li><li>Creamy mashed potatoes, buttery polenta, or crusty bread</li></ul><hr><h2 id=step-by-step-recipe-braising-short-ribs-to-perfection>Step-by-Step Recipe: Braising Short Ribs to Perfection</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-short-ribs>Step 1: Prepare the Short Ribs</h3><p>The foundation of tender short ribs starts with a proper preparation stage. Begin by patting the short ribs dry with paper towels—this removes excess moisture and allows the meat to develop a deeper crust when seared later. Generously season both sides of the ribs with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.</p><p>For an optional crispy coating, lightly dredge the short ribs in all-purpose flour. This step helps to create an even more luxurious texture while also enhancing the thickness of the braising liquids later.</p><hr><h3 id=step-2-sear-the-meat>Step 2: Sear the Meat</h3><p>Heat a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add olive oil, letting it warm until shimmering. Sear the short ribs in batches, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Sear for about 3–4 minutes per side, or until the ribs are deep golden brown. This caramelized crust locks in juices and adds robust flavor to the finished dish.</p><p>Once the ribs are seared, remove them from the pot and set them aside on a plate.</p><hr><h3 id=step-3-build-the-flavor-base>Step 3: Build the Flavor Base</h3><p>Reduce the heat to medium and add the diced onion, carrots, and celery to the pot. Sauté the vegetables for about 5–7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften and caramelize. Add the garlic and cook for another minute, or until fragrant.</p><p>Next, stir in the tomato paste, letting it cook for 2 minutes to intensify its flavors. At this point, the bottom of your pot should have developed a layer of flavorful fond—the browned bits packed with taste. Don’t worry; you’ll deglaze the pot in the next step.</p><hr><h3 id=step-4-deglaze-and-add-liquid>Step 4: Deglaze and Add Liquid</h3><p>Turn up the heat slightly and pour in the red wine. As it simmers, use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up all the golden bits from the bottom of the pot. Let the wine reduce by half, which should take about 7–10 minutes. This reduction concentrates the flavors and adds complexity to the braising liquid.</p><p>Once the wine has reduced, add the beef stock, Worcestershire sauce, and any optional seasonings like smoked paprika or cayenne pepper. Stir well to combine. Nestle the short ribs back into the pot, ensuring they’re mostly submerged in the liquid.</p><hr><h3 id=step-5-add-herbs-and-braise>Step 5: Add Herbs and Braise</h3><p>Tie the thyme sprigs and rosemary sprigs together with kitchen twine for easy removal later, and tuck them into the pot alongside the bay leaves.</p><p>Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and transfer it to a preheated oven at 325°F (163°C). Allow the ribs to braise for 2.5 to 3 hours. About halfway through, check the liquid levels—if it’s running low, add a splash of beef stock or water to prevent drying.</p><p>The low-and-slow heat transforms the ribs into tender morsels that practically melt in your mouth. The connective tissues break down over time while the flavors meld together into a luxurious sauce.</p><hr><h3 id=step-6-test-for-doneness>Step 6: Test for Doneness</h3><p>Once the ribs have braised for several hours, use a fork to test their tenderness. The meat should easily pull away from the bone. If it feels tough, return the pot to the oven and continue braising in 20-minute increments until the ribs reach their desired tenderness.</p><hr><h3 id=step-7-reduce-the-sauce-optional>Step 7: Reduce the Sauce (Optional)</h3><p>For a thicker, more concentrated sauce, carefully remove the short ribs from the pot and set them aside on a serving platter. Discard the herb bundle and bay leaves. Place the pot over medium heat and simmer the braising liquid until it reduces to your preferred consistency. This step is optional but results in an even more decadent sauce to complement the ribs.</p><hr><h3 id=step-8-plate-and-serve>Step 8: Plate and Serve</h3><p>When you’re ready to serve, spoon the reduced sauce over the short ribs. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color and freshness.</p><p>Pair the braised short ribs with creamy mashed potatoes, buttery polenta, or a slice of rustic, crusty bread to soak up every bit of that rich sauce. A side of roasted vegetables or a crisp green salad completes the meal beautifully.</p><hr><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-braised-short-ribs>Tips for Perfect Braised Short Ribs</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Choose the Right Meat</strong><br>Bone-in short ribs are ideal for braising because the marrow adds incredible depth to the sauce. If boneless ribs are your only option, they’ll still turn out delicious—just note that the flavor may be slightly less intense.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t Rush the Process</strong><br>Braising is all about patience. The slow cooking process gradually breaks down the muscle fibers, resulting in tender meat. Cutting corners could leave you with tough or dry ribs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keep the Seasoning Balanced</strong><br>Taste your braising liquid periodically to adjust the saltiness and overall flavor. Remember that as the sauce reduces, the flavors intensify.</p></li><li><p><strong>Invest in a Good Dutch Oven</strong><br>A heavy-duty Dutch oven retains heat evenly and is perfect for braising recipes like this one. It’s a worthwhile investment for anyone passionate about cooking.</p></li></ol><hr><h2 id=why-braised-short-ribs-are-worth-the-effort>Why Braised Short Ribs Are Worth the Effort</h2><p>Braised short ribs are more than just a meal—they’re an experience. The aroma that wafts through your kitchen as the ribs simmer alone is worth the time and effort, and the dish itself feels like a warm embrace on a plate. By mastering this recipe, you’ll be able to recreate a restaurant-worthy dish in the comfort of your own home.</p><p>From the tender meat to the rich, velvety sauce, there’s little not to love about braised short ribs. Whether you’re cooking for a special occasion or treating yourself to an indulgent dinner, this recipe is guaranteed to become a staple in your repertoire.
