They are versatile, making them an excellent side dish or a meal on their own. But the process of baking potatoes traditionally in the oven can take up to an hour, and that might not always fit into your busy schedule. This is where the Instant Pot comes in to save the day, turning your potato cravings into a quick and easy meal in just a fraction of the time.</p><p>In this blog post, we’ll walk you through how to make perfectly baked potatoes using your Instant Pot. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a speedy weeknight dinner or a hassle-free way to prepare baked potatoes for a family gathering, this recipe will guide you every step of the way.</p><h2 id=why-use-an-instant-pot-for-baked-potatoes>Why Use an Instant Pot for Baked Potatoes?</h2><p>If you’ve ever made baked potatoes in the oven, you know that it can take a while. The Instant Pot, however, is a game-changer when it comes to cooking potatoes quickly and evenly. Here are a few reasons why using the Instant Pot to bake potatoes is a fantastic idea:</p><ul><li><strong>Faster Cooking Time:</strong> Traditional baked potatoes can take 45 minutes to an hour in the oven, but with the Instant Pot, you can have your potatoes ready in just 20 to 25 minutes.</li><li><strong>Perfectly Fluffy Potatoes:</strong> The pressure cooker works by sealing in steam, which helps to create soft, fluffy potatoes on the inside while keeping the skins perfectly tender.</li><li><strong>Hands-Off Cooking:</strong> Once you set the timer and the Instant Pot starts, you can walk away and let it do the work. No need to keep checking on your potatoes.</li><li><strong>Energy-Efficient:</strong> Using the Instant Pot takes less energy compared to preheating your oven for an hour or more.</li></ul><p>Let’s dive into the details and show you how to make the perfect Instant Pot baked potatoes.</p><h2 id=ingredients-youll-need>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2><p>Making Instant Pot baked potatoes requires just a few simple ingredients:</p><ul><li>4 medium to large russet potatoes (or any variety you prefer, but russet potatoes give the best results for baking)</li><li>1 cup of water (for pressure cooking)</li><li>Olive oil (optional)</li><li>Salt (optional, for seasoning)</li><li>Toppings of your choice (butter, sour cream, cheese, chives, bacon, etc.)</li></ul><p>You can also add other seasonings or flavors to suit your preferences. Whether you like to keep things simple or dress your potatoes up with a variety of toppings, this recipe provides a great base for creativity.</p><h2 id=how-to-make-instant-pot-baked-potatoes>How to Make Instant Pot Baked Potatoes</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-your-potatoes>Step 1: Prepare Your Potatoes</h3><p>First, wash your potatoes thoroughly. Russet potatoes tend to have dirt on their skins, so it’s important to scrub them clean. After rinsing, use a paper towel to dry them off.</p><p>Next, you can choose to prick the potatoes with a fork to allow steam to escape while cooking. However, it’s not strictly necessary since the Instant Pot will manage the steam inside the pot. For a more evenly cooked result, you can rub a little olive oil on the skins, which will also give them a crispier texture after cooking. If you prefer, sprinkle a little salt on the skins as well for added flavor.</p><h3 id=step-2-add-water-to-the-instant-pot>Step 2: Add Water to the Instant Pot</h3><p>Place the trivet or a steamer basket inside the Instant Pot. Add 1 cup of water to the bottom of the pot. This step is crucial, as the water creates steam and helps the Instant Pot achieve the pressure necessary to cook the potatoes quickly.</p><h3 id=step-3-arrange-the-potatoes>Step 3: Arrange the Potatoes</h3><p>Now, place your potatoes on top of the trivet or in the steamer basket. You can stack them if necessary, but try to avoid overcrowding the Instant Pot. This will help the potatoes cook evenly.</p><h3 id=step-4-set-the-instant-pot-to-pressure-cook>Step 4: Set the Instant Pot to Pressure Cook</h3><p>Close the lid of your Instant Pot and make sure the vent is in the sealed position. Set the Instant Pot to <strong>Pressure Cook (High)</strong> for <strong>12-20 minutes</strong>, depending on the size of your potatoes. For medium-sized potatoes, 12 minutes should be sufficient. For larger potatoes, you may need to increase the time to 18-20 minutes.</p><ul><li><strong>Small Potatoes:</strong> 12-14 minutes</li><li><strong>Medium Potatoes:</strong> 14-16 minutes</li><li><strong>Large Potatoes:</strong> 18-20 minutes</li></ul><p>After setting the cooking time, let the Instant Pot come to pressure, which will take a few minutes.</p><h3 id=step-5-quick-or-natural-release>Step 5: Quick or Natural Release</h3><p>Once the cooking time is complete, you have two options for releasing the pressure:</p><ul><li><strong>Quick Release:</strong> Carefully turn the venting knob to release the pressure. This method will stop the cooking process quickly.</li><li><strong>Natural Release:</strong> Let the Instant Pot sit for 10-15 minutes after the cooking time is complete. This allows the pressure to release naturally, which can result in softer potatoes.</li></ul><p>For baked potatoes, both release methods work well, but many people prefer the quick release for a firmer texture.</p><h3 id=step-6-check-for-doneness>Step 6: Check for Doneness</h3><p>After releasing the pressure, open the Instant Pot lid and check the potatoes with a fork. The potatoes should be soft and easily pierced. If they are still firm, return them to the Instant Pot and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.</p><h3 id=step-7-serve-and-enjoy>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Once your baked potatoes are done, you can serve them immediately. If you like crispy skins, you can quickly place the potatoes under the broiler for a minute or two to crisp them up, but this step is optional.</p><p>Slice the potatoes open and fluff the insides with a fork. Add your favorite toppings, such as butter, sour cream, shredded cheese, chives, bacon bits, or any other toppings you enjoy.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-instant-pot-baked-potatoes>Tips for Perfect Instant Pot Baked Potatoes</h2><p>While this recipe is straightforward, here are a few tips to ensure you get the best results:</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t Skip the Trivet or Steamer Basket:</strong> The trivet or steamer basket elevates the potatoes off the bottom of the pot, ensuring that they cook evenly and don’t become soggy.</li><li><strong>Adjust the Cooking Time Based on Potato Size:</strong> The larger the potato, the longer it will need to cook. Use the suggested cooking times as a guideline but adjust according to the size of your potatoes.</li><li><strong>Wrap in Foil for Extra Tenderness:</strong> If you prefer super-soft, melt-in-your-mouth potatoes, you can wrap them individually in aluminum foil before placing them in the Instant Pot. This is an optional step but adds extra moisture.</li><li><strong>Rest the Potatoes After Cooking:</strong> After you release the pressure, let the potatoes rest for a few minutes before serving. This will allow the moisture to redistribute and help keep the insides fluffy.</li></ul><h2 id=different-ways-to-serve-instant-pot-baked-potatoes>Different Ways to Serve Instant Pot Baked Potatoes</h2><p>The beauty of baked potatoes is their versatility.
