One such dish is Ntomatorizo, or Greek tomato rice. This simple, yet flavorful rice dish is a staple in Greek households, offering a perfect balance of savory and tangy tastes. Traditionally enjoyed as a side dish or a main course during summer months, Greek tomato rice is comforting, hearty, and incredibly versatile. In this post, we’ll dive deep into how you can make this authentic dish just like a native chef, bringing a piece of Greece into your kitchen.</p><h2 id=what-is-ntomatorizo>What Is Ntomatorizo?</h2><p>Ntomatorizo (Ντοματόρυζο) is a traditional Greek dish made by cooking rice with tomatoes, olive oil, and a variety of aromatic herbs and spices. While there are many regional variations of this dish, the base remains the same: plump, tender rice cooked in a flavorful tomato sauce. The beauty of Ntomatorizo lies in its simplicity—using just a few ingredients that complement each other perfectly.</p><p>This dish is often served alongside grilled meats, seafood, or as a vegetarian meal on its own. The tangy tomatoes meld beautifully with the rice, making it a comforting option for any occasion. It’s also a dish that can easily be customized with additional ingredients like onions, garlic, or bell peppers, depending on your personal preferences.</p><h2 id=ingredients-youll-need>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2><p>To prepare Ntomatorizo, you will need the following fresh ingredients, many of which are pantry staples in Greek cooking:</p><ul><li><strong>2 cups of long-grain white rice</strong>: While any variety of rice can be used, long-grain rice is typically preferred for its texture and ability to remain fluffy.</li><li><strong>3 medium-sized ripe tomatoes</strong>: Use fresh, ripe tomatoes for the best flavor. You can also opt for canned crushed tomatoes if fresh ones aren’t available.</li><li><strong>1 small onion</strong>: A finely chopped onion adds sweetness and depth to the dish.</li><li><strong>2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</strong>: Greek olive oil is a must for this dish, as it imparts a rich, fruity flavor.</li><li><strong>2 cups of vegetable or chicken broth</strong>: The broth enhances the richness of the rice and helps the grains absorb all the flavors from the tomatoes and spices.</li><li><strong>1 teaspoon of dried oregano</strong>: Oregano is a classic herb in Greek cuisine and adds an earthy, aromatic flavor to the rice.</li><li><strong>1 bay leaf</strong>: The bay leaf adds a subtle complexity to the dish.</li><li><strong>Salt and pepper to taste</strong>: Season to your liking.</li><li><strong>A small pinch of sugar (optional)</strong>: Adding sugar can help balance out the acidity of the tomatoes, giving the rice a smoother, more rounded flavor.</li><li><strong>Fresh parsley or dill for garnish</strong>: Fresh herbs are commonly used in Greek cooking to add brightness and color.</li></ul><h3 id=optional-add-ins>Optional Add-ins:</h3><ul><li><strong>1 red bell pepper</strong>: Sautéed alongside the onion, it adds sweetness and a slight crunch.</li><li><strong>A few cloves of garlic</strong>: For an extra burst of flavor.</li><li><strong>Feta cheese</strong>: Crumbled feta can be sprinkled on top to bring a creamy, salty element to the dish.</li></ul><h2 id=step-by-step-guide-to-making-greek-tomato-rice>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Greek Tomato Rice</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-tomatoes>Step 1: Prepare the Tomatoes</h3><p>Begin by preparing your tomatoes. If you are using fresh tomatoes, make an ‘X’ on the bottom of each tomato with a knife and blanch them in boiling water for about 30 seconds. Once they’ve been blanched, transfer them immediately to a bowl of ice water. This will make peeling the skin off much easier. After peeling, chop the tomatoes finely or use a food processor to crush them.</p><p>If you are using canned tomatoes, skip this step and simply measure out 2 cups of crushed tomatoes. Canned tomatoes can provide a more intense, concentrated tomato flavor, especially if fresh tomatoes are not in season.</p><h3 id=step-2-sauté-the-onion-and-optional-bell-pepper>Step 2: Sauté the Onion (and Optional Bell Pepper)</h3><p>In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onion (and bell pepper, if using) and sauté for about 5-7 minutes, until the onions are soft and translucent. This step is crucial, as it brings out the sweetness of the onion and infuses the oil with flavor.</p><p>If you’re adding garlic, you can throw in the minced garlic at this stage and sauté for another 1-2 minutes, being careful not to burn it.</p><h3 id=step-3-add-the-tomatoes-and-spices>Step 3: Add the Tomatoes and Spices</h3><p>Once the onions have softened, add the prepared tomatoes to the pan. Stir the mixture to combine the tomatoes with the onions, allowing the flavors to meld. Add the dried oregano, bay leaf, salt, pepper, and optional sugar. The sugar helps balance the acidity of the tomatoes, especially if they are particularly tart.</p><p>Let the tomato mixture simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened slightly and the flavors have deepened.</p><h3 id=step-4-cook-the-rice>Step 4: Cook the Rice</h3><p>Add the rice to the pan with the tomato sauce, stirring to coat the grains with the tomato mixture. This step is essential for infusing the rice with the rich tomato flavor.</p><p>Next, pour in the vegetable or chicken broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid, and let the rice simmer gently for about 20-25 minutes. During this time, the rice will absorb the tomato-infused broth and become tender and fluffy.</p><p>It’s important to avoid stirring the rice too much while it cooks. Stirring can cause the rice to become sticky and lose its texture. Just let it cook undisturbed until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is cooked through.</p><h3 id=step-5-let-it-rest>Step 5: Let It Rest</h3><p>Once the rice is done cooking, remove the pan from the heat and let it sit, covered, for another 5-10 minutes. This resting period helps the rice settle and ensures that the grains remain fluffy.</p><h3 id=step-6-garnish-and-serve>Step 6: Garnish and Serve</h3><p>Finally, discard the bay leaf and fluff the rice with a fork. Garnish with fresh parsley or dill to add a burst of color and freshness. You can also sprinkle some crumbled feta cheese on top for added richness and a creamy contrast to the tangy tomatoes.</p><p>Serve Ntomatorizo as a side dish with grilled meats, fish, or vegetables, or enjoy it as a satisfying main course with a side of Greek salad. It’s also a fantastic option for meal prep, as it keeps well in the fridge for a few days and can easily be reheated.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-ntomatorizo>Tips for Perfect Ntomatorizo</h2><ul><li><strong>Rice choice</strong>: Although long-grain rice is the most common choice for this dish, you can also use short-grain rice or even brown rice for a heartier variation. Just keep in mind that cooking times may vary depending on the type of rice used.</li><li><strong>Tomato variation</strong>: If you want a richer tomato flavor, consider using tomato paste in addition to fresh or canned tomatoes. This will give the rice a deeper, more concentrated taste.</li><li><strong>Broth vs. Water</strong>: For a more flavorful dish, always use broth instead of water. The broth adds depth and richness to the rice that plain water cannot provide.</li><li><strong>Herbs and spices</strong>: While oregano is the traditional herb used in Ntomatorizo, feel free to experiment with other Greek herbs like thyme, basil, or rosemary for a different twist on the classic recipe.</li><li><strong>Vegan option</strong>: Ntomatorizo is naturally vegan, but if you want to add a touch of richness, consider incorporating olives, capers, or roasted vegetables.</li></ul><h2 id=why-greek-tomato-rice-is-so-popular>Why Greek Tomato Rice Is So Popular</h2><p>Greek tomato rice is not just a dish; it’s a reflection of the Mediterranean lifestyle. Simple, wholesome ingredients come together to create a meal that’s not only satisfying but also packed with nutrients. The combination of tomatoes, olive oil, and rice makes for a balanced dish that offers plenty of fiber, antioxidants, and healthy fats.</p><p>Moreover, this dish is incredibly flexible. Whether served as a vegetarian main or paired with grilled lamb, chicken, or fish, Greek tomato rice complements a wide variety of foods. It’s a perfect example of how Mediterranean cuisine focuses on fresh, flavorful ingredients that can be used in countless combinations to create mouthwatering meals.</p><h2 id=variations-of-ntomatorizo>Variations of Ntomatorizo</h2><p>While the basic recipe for Greek tomato rice is delightful on its own, there are several ways to modify it based on personal preferences or regional influences. Here are some variations to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Seafood Ntomatorizo</strong>: For a coastal twist, you can add shrimp, squid, or even mussels to the rice. Just add the seafood during the last few minutes of cooking so they don’t overcook and become rubbery.</li><li><strong>Stuffed Tomato Rice</strong>: In some parts of Greece, Ntomatorizo is served inside hollowed-out tomatoes, creating a visually stunning and flavorful dish. This is particularly popular during the summer months when tomatoes are in season.</li><li><strong>Lentil and Tomato Rice</strong>: For a protein-packed variation, you can add cooked lentils to the rice. The earthy flavor of lentils pairs perfectly with the tangy tomato sauce and offers an extra layer of texture.</li><li><strong>Baked Tomato Rice</strong>: Another variation is to bake the rice in the oven. After cooking the rice on the stovetop, transfer it to a baking dish, cover it with foil, and bake for about 30 minutes at 350°F (175°C) for a crispy, golden crust.</li></ul><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Greek tomato rice (Ntomatorizo) is a simple, flavorful dish that captures the essence of Greek cuisine: fresh ingredients, bold flavors, and a focus on quality over complexity.
