The cream and coconut milk used in both the cake batter and the frosting create a cake that’s not only flavorful but also melt-in-your-mouth tender. It’s a dessert that’s perfect for both casual gatherings and special occasions.</p><p>The good news? You don’t need to be an expert baker to make this cake. With the right ingredients and a little patience, you can create a stunning coconut cream cake that rivals any bakery version.</p><h2 id=ingredients-youll-need>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2><p>Before we dive into the process of making this coconut cream cake, let’s go over the ingredients you&rsquo;ll need. Don&rsquo;t worry if you’re not familiar with some of the terms – we’ll explain everything.</p><h3 id=for-the-cake>For the Cake:</h3><ul><li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li><li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li><li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li><li>½ teaspoon salt</li><li>1 cup unsalted butter (room temperature)</li><li>1 ½ cups granulated sugar</li><li>4 large eggs (room temperature)</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><li>1 cup coconut milk (full-fat for best flavor)</li><li>1 cup shredded unsweetened coconut (preferably finely shredded)</li><li>1 tablespoon coconut extract (optional for extra coconut flavor)</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-coconut-cream-filling>For the Coconut Cream Filling:</h3><ul><li>1 ½ cups heavy cream</li><li>½ cup sweetened condensed milk</li><li>½ cup coconut cream (you can find this in most grocery stores)</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-frosting>For the Frosting:</h3><ul><li>8 oz cream cheese (room temperature)</li><li>1 cup unsalted butter (room temperature)</li><li>3 ½ cups powdered sugar (sifted)</li><li>1 teaspoon coconut extract</li><li>2 cups shredded coconut (toasted or untoasted, depending on your preference)</li></ul><h2 id=step-by-step-instructions-for-making-coconut-cream-cake>Step-by-Step Instructions for Making Coconut Cream Cake</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-your-oven-and-cake-pans>Step 1: Prepare Your Oven and Cake Pans</h3><p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This is the optimal temperature for baking a moist coconut cream cake without drying it out. Next, grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. If you prefer, you can line the bottom of each pan with parchment paper to ensure the cake comes out easily once baked.</p><h3 id=step-2-mix-dry-ingredients>Step 2: Mix Dry Ingredients</h3><p>In a medium-sized bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Sifting helps eliminate any lumps in the flour and ensures an even distribution of the leavening agents. Set the dry ingredients aside while you work on the wet ingredients.</p><h3 id=step-3-cream-the-butter-and-sugar>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3><p>In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer or stand mixer to cream together the unsalted butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This process usually takes about 3-5 minutes. The air incorporated into the butter-sugar mixture helps create a light, airy texture in the cake.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-eggs-and-vanilla>Step 4: Add Eggs and Vanilla</h3><p>Once the butter and sugar are fully creamed, add the eggs, one at a time. Beat well after each addition. This ensures that the eggs are fully incorporated and the batter is smooth. After the eggs are fully mixed in, add the vanilla extract and mix again.</p><h3 id=step-5-alternate-adding-dry-ingredients-and-coconut-milk>Step 5: Alternate Adding Dry Ingredients and Coconut Milk</h3><p>Now, begin adding the dry ingredients and coconut milk alternately to the butter mixture. Start by adding one-third of the dry ingredients, mixing just until incorporated. Then, add half of the coconut milk, and continue alternating until all the dry ingredients and coconut milk are mixed in. Be careful not to overmix the batter, as this could result in a dense cake.</p><h3 id=step-6-fold-in-shredded-coconut>Step 6: Fold in Shredded Coconut</h3><p>Once the wet and dry ingredients are combined, fold in the shredded coconut. This will add texture and an extra burst of coconut flavor throughout the cake. You can use either sweetened or unsweetened coconut, depending on how sweet you want the cake to be.</p><h3 id=step-7-bake-the-cake>Step 7: Bake the Cake</h3><p>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Every oven is different, so keep an eye on your cake as it bakes. Once baked, remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Afterward, transfer the cakes to a wire rack to cool completely.</p><h3 id=step-8-make-the-coconut-cream-filling>Step 8: Make the Coconut Cream Filling</h3><p>While your cakes are cooling, it’s time to prepare the coconut cream filling. In a mixing bowl, combine the heavy cream, sweetened condensed milk, coconut cream, and vanilla extract. Using a hand mixer or stand mixer, beat the ingredients together until stiff peaks form. This mixture should be thick and fluffy but not over-beaten.</p><p>Once the cream is ready, refrigerate it until you are ready to assemble the cake. This will help it set and maintain its shape when layered.</p><h3 id=step-9-make-the-frosting>Step 9: Make the Frosting</h3><p>Now, it’s time to prepare the frosting. In a large mixing bowl, beat together the softened cream cheese and unsalted butter until smooth and creamy. Gradually add the sifted powdered sugar, one cup at a time, mixing well between each addition. Once the sugar is fully incorporated, add the coconut extract and beat until smooth.</p><p>If the frosting seems too thick, you can add a little bit of milk, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency. The frosting should be thick enough to spread easily but not too stiff to pipe.</p><h3 id=step-10-assemble-the-cake>Step 10: Assemble the Cake</h3><p>Once the cakes are completely cooled, it’s time to assemble your coconut cream cake. Place one layer of the cake on a serving platter or cake stand. Spread a generous amount of the coconut cream filling over the top, smoothing it out to the edges. Place the second cake layer on top and gently press down to secure it.</p><p>Next, spread a thin crumb coat of frosting over the entire cake. This helps lock in any crumbs and gives you a smooth surface for the final layer of frosting. After the crumb coat, refrigerate the cake for 20-30 minutes to allow the frosting to set.</p><p>Once the crumb coat has set, apply the remaining frosting to the cake. Use an offset spatula to spread it evenly over the top and sides. If you prefer a rustic look, you can leave the frosting slightly textured.</p><h3 id=step-11-garnish-with-shredded-coconut>Step 11: Garnish with Shredded Coconut</h3><p>For the finishing touch, sprinkle the top and sides of the cake with shredded coconut. If you prefer toasted coconut, simply toast the shredded coconut in a dry pan over medium heat for a few minutes until golden brown. Let the coconut cool before applying it to the cake for a beautiful, crunchy texture.</p><h3 id=step-12-let-the-cake-set>Step 12: Let the Cake Set</h3><p>Allow the cake to set for at least an hour before slicing and serving. This gives the coconut cream filling and frosting time to firm up and ensures that each slice will hold its shape. The flavors will meld together beautifully, and you’ll be left with a rich, moist coconut cream cake.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-coconut-cream-cake>Tips for Perfect Coconut Cream Cake</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients:</strong> For the best texture, make sure your butter, eggs, and cream cheese are at room temperature. This helps everything mix together smoothly and ensures a light, fluffy cake.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter:</strong> Overmixing the cake batter can result in a dense, tough cake. Mix just until the dry ingredients are incorporated, and be gentle when folding in the shredded coconut.</p></li><li><p><strong>Toast the Coconut for Extra Flavor:</strong> Toasting the coconut adds an extra layer of flavor and texture to your cake. If you like a deeper coconut flavor, consider using toasted coconut both inside the cake and as a garnish.</p></li><li><p><strong>Refrigerate the Cake Before Serving:</strong> Refrigerating the cake before serving allows the coconut cream filling and frosting to firm up, making it easier to cut clean slices. Plus, it enhances the flavor and texture.</p></li></ul><h2 id=why-youll-love-this-coconut-cream-cake>Why You’ll Love This Coconut Cream Cake</h2><p>This moist coconut cream cake is perfect for any occasion, from birthdays to holidays and everything in between.
