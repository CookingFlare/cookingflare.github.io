This dish brings together tender beef, crisp broccoli, and a savory sauce that is full of rich flavors, all cooked together in an Instant Pot in less than 30 minutes. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a weeknight meal or something special for a busy weekend, this dish is sure to hit the mark.</p><p>In this post, we&rsquo;ll explore everything you need to know to make this delicious dish, from ingredients and preparation to step-by-step instructions. Plus, we&rsquo;ll provide helpful tips and variations to ensure that you can tailor this recipe to your taste. Let’s dive into the world of Instant Pot cooking with this simple yet mouthwatering Beef and Broccoli recipe.</p><h2 id=why-choose-instant-pot-for-beef-and-broccoli>Why Choose Instant Pot for Beef and Broccoli?</h2><p>The Instant Pot is a game-changer when it comes to cooking meals quickly without sacrificing flavor. Unlike traditional stovetop or oven methods, the Instant Pot combines multiple cooking functions (pressure cooking, sautéing, slow cooking, and more) into one appliance, making it the ultimate tool for busy weeknights. The beauty of this Instant Pot Beef and Broccoli recipe is that it cuts down on cooking time significantly, while still allowing all the flavors to meld together perfectly.</p><p>By using the pressure-cooking function, the beef becomes incredibly tender in a fraction of the time it would take using conventional cooking methods. The broccoli, on the other hand, stays bright green and crisp, offering the perfect contrast to the tender beef. The sauce brings everything together with a touch of sweetness, saltiness, and umami flavors, making this dish an irresistible comfort meal.</p><h2 id=the-key-ingredients>The Key Ingredients</h2><p>Before you start cooking, let’s take a look at the key ingredients needed for Instant Pot Beef and Broccoli. The recipe is simple, yet every ingredient plays an essential role in building that signature flavor combination.</p><h3 id=beef>Beef</h3><p>For the beef, you’ll want to choose a cut that’s tender and quick to cook. Flank steak, sirloin, or ribeye are excellent options. These cuts are flavorful and tender enough to cook quickly in the Instant Pot without becoming tough or chewy. Slice the beef thinly against the grain for the best texture and tenderness.</p><h3 id=broccoli>Broccoli</h3><p>Fresh broccoli is the best option for this recipe, as it cooks quickly and retains its crisp texture when pressure-cooked. While frozen broccoli can be used in a pinch, it tends to become mushy and may not provide the same satisfying crunch.</p><h3 id=soy-sauce>Soy Sauce</h3><p>Soy sauce is the foundation of the sauce for this dish. It provides a savory, salty base that enhances the flavor of the beef and vegetables. You can use regular soy sauce, low-sodium soy sauce, or tamari if you&rsquo;re looking for a gluten-free option.</p><h3 id=brown-sugar>Brown Sugar</h3><p>The brown sugar adds a touch of sweetness to balance out the salty soy sauce. It also helps create a rich, caramelized glaze for the beef. For a healthier option, you can substitute the brown sugar with honey or maple syrup, although the flavor will differ slightly.</p><h3 id=garlic>Garlic</h3><p>Fresh garlic adds an aromatic depth to the dish. It pairs beautifully with the savory soy sauce and the natural sweetness of the brown sugar, contributing to the overall flavor profile.</p><h3 id=ginger>Ginger</h3><p>Ginger gives the dish a subtle warmth and a slight spiciness that elevates the flavor of the beef and broccoli. Fresh ginger is preferable, but ground ginger can also work if that’s what you have on hand.</p><h3 id=cornstarch>Cornstarch</h3><p>Cornstarch is used to thicken the sauce once the beef and broccoli are cooked. It creates a glossy, rich sauce that clings to the beef and vegetables, making every bite flavorful and satisfying.</p><h3 id=beef-broth>Beef Broth</h3><p>Beef broth is used to provide moisture and a rich, meaty flavor. It’s the perfect base for the sauce and ensures that the beef doesn’t dry out while cooking under pressure.</p><h2 id=preparation-how-to-make-instant-pot-beef-and-broccoli>Preparation: How to Make Instant Pot Beef and Broccoli</h2><p>Now that we’ve covered the ingredients, let’s dive into the steps for preparing this delicious meal in your Instant Pot. With just a few simple steps, you&rsquo;ll have a flavorful dinner on the table in no time.</p><h3 id=step-1-slice-the-beef>Step 1: Slice the Beef</h3><p>Start by thinly slicing your beef against the grain. This is important because slicing against the grain helps ensure that the beef remains tender and easy to chew. If you’re using flank steak or another cut of beef, make sure to slice it into strips that are about 1/4-inch thick. You can also cut the beef into bite-sized pieces, depending on your preference.</p><h3 id=step-2-prepare-the-sauce>Step 2: Prepare the Sauce</h3><p>In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, minced garlic, grated ginger, and beef broth. Stir until the sugar has dissolved completely, creating a savory and slightly sweet sauce that will coat the beef and broccoli.</p><h3 id=step-3-sauté-the-beef>Step 3: Sauté the Beef</h3><p>Set your Instant Pot to the &ldquo;Sauté&rdquo; mode. Once it&rsquo;s hot, add a small amount of oil (such as vegetable or canola oil) to the pot. Add the sliced beef to the pot in a single layer and sauté for 2-3 minutes, just until the beef begins to brown. You don’t need to cook it through at this stage; the beef will finish cooking under pressure.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-the-sauce>Step 4: Add the Sauce</h3><p>Once the beef has browned, pour the prepared sauce over the beef in the Instant Pot. Stir to combine, making sure the beef is evenly coated with the sauce. This is where the magic happens—this sauce is what gives the beef its rich, savory flavor.</p><h3 id=step-5-pressure-cook-the-beef>Step 5: Pressure Cook the Beef</h3><p>Close the Instant Pot lid and set the valve to the &ldquo;Sealing&rdquo; position. Set the Instant Pot to cook on high pressure for 8 minutes. After the cooking time is up, allow the pressure to release naturally for 5 minutes, and then perform a quick release to release the remaining pressure. This ensures that the beef is tender and juicy.</p><h3 id=step-6-add-the-broccoli>Step 6: Add the Broccoli</h3><p>Once the pressure has been released, carefully open the Instant Pot lid. Add the broccoli florets to the pot, making sure they’re evenly distributed over the beef. Close the lid again and set the Instant Pot to cook on high pressure for an additional 1-2 minutes. This will cook the broccoli just enough to keep it crisp-tender, without becoming mushy.</p><h3 id=step-7-thicken-the-sauce>Step 7: Thicken the Sauce</h3><p>After the broccoli has cooked, carefully open the lid again. In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of cornstarch with 2 tablespoons of water to make a slurry. Stir the slurry into the Instant Pot, then set the Instant Pot to &ldquo;Sauté&rdquo; mode again. Allow the sauce to simmer for 2-3 minutes, or until it thickens to a glossy, rich consistency.</p><h3 id=step-8-serve-and-enjoy>Step 8: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Once the sauce has thickened, give everything a final stir to coat the beef and broccoli in the sauce. Taste the dish and adjust the seasoning, if necessary. Serve your Instant Pot Beef and Broccoli over steamed rice or noodles for a complete meal.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-perfect-instant-pot-beef-and-broccoli>Tips for the Perfect Instant Pot Beef and Broccoli</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Slice the Beef Thinly</strong>: For the most tender results, make sure to slice the beef thinly against the grain. This helps break down the muscle fibers and ensures that the beef is tender.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t Overcook the Broccoli</strong>: Broccoli cooks quickly under pressure, so it’s important to add it at the right time. Overcooking it can lead to a mushy texture, which we want to avoid. Keep the broccoli bright and slightly crisp for the best result.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adjust the Sauce to Your Taste</strong>: If you prefer a sweeter dish, feel free to add more brown sugar. If you like it saltier, you can add more soy sauce. Adjust the garlic and ginger to suit your flavor preferences as well.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Low-Sodium Soy Sauce</strong>: If you&rsquo;re watching your sodium intake, using low-sodium soy sauce can help reduce the overall saltiness of the dish while still providing that signature savory flavor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it Spicy</strong>: For a spicy kick, add a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce, or drizzle the finished dish with sriracha.</p></li></ul><h2 id=variations-to-try>Variations to Try</h2><p>While Instant Pot Beef and Broccoli is delicious as it is, there are plenty of ways to mix things up based on your preferences or what you have on hand.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Add Mushrooms</strong>: Mushrooms are a great addition to this dish. Slice them thinly and add them to the pot with the beef for a hearty, umami boost.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add Bell Peppers</strong>: For a pop of color and a touch of sweetness, add sliced bell peppers to the Instant Pot along with the broccoli. They’ll cook up quickly and add some variety to the dish.</p></li><li><p><strong>Switch Up the Vegetables</strong>: If you’re not a fan of broccoli, you can swap it for other vegetables such as snow peas, asparagus, or green beans. Just be sure to adjust the cooking time depending on the vegetable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make It Gluten-Free</strong>: For a gluten-free version of this dish, simply use tamari instead of soy sauce and make sure your beef broth is gluten-free.</p></li></ul><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Instant Pot Beef and Broccoli is an incredibly easy and delicious dish that brings all the flavors of a takeout favorite into the comfort of your home. With tender beef, crisp broccoli, and a rich, savory sauce, this dish is perfect for busy nights when you want a wholesome, satisfying meal. The best part?
