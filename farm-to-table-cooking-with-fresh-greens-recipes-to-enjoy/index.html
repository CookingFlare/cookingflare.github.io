Its slightly bitter flavor is perfect for adding contrast to sweeter ingredients like fruits and roasted vegetables. Arugula is great in salads, sandwiches, and even on top of pizzas.</p><h3 id=4-swiss-chard>4. Swiss Chard</h3><p>Swiss chard is a colorful green that comes in vibrant hues like red, yellow, and orange. It has a slightly earthy flavor and is delicious when sautéed or added to soups and stews.

Here are a few tips to keep your farm-to-table greens fresh:</p><ul><li><strong>Refrigeration</strong>: Most fresh greens, like kale, spinach, and lettuce, should be stored in the fridge. Place them in a produce drawer or a perforated plastic bag to allow airflow and reduce moisture, which can cause wilting.</li><li><strong>Hydration</strong>: If your greens start to wilt, try soaking them in ice-cold water for 10-15 minutes to revive their freshness.</li><li><strong>Keep Them Dry</strong>: Excess moisture can cause greens to rot faster, so be sure to dry them thoroughly before storing them. You can use a salad spinner or gently pat them dry with a paper towel.</li></ul><p>Proper storage will help extend the shelf life of your greens and ensure they stay fresh and ready to use in your recipes.</p><h2 id=delicious-farm-to-table-green-recipes>Delicious Farm-to-Table Green Recipes</h2><p>Now that you know the benefits of fresh greens and how to store them, let’s dive into some farm-to-table recipes that make the most of these vibrant vegetables.</p><h3 id=1-kale-caesar-salad>1.
