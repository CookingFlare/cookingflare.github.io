If you’ve ever tasted this dessert at a Thai restaurant or during a summer vacation, you know exactly how comforting and satisfying it can be. Now, you can recreate that experience at home with a vegan-friendly version that everyone will love!</p><h2 id=what-makes-vegan-mango-sticky-rice-so-special>What Makes Vegan Mango Sticky Rice So Special?</h2><p>Mango sticky rice is the ultimate tropical comfort food. The soft, sweet mangoes paired with the creamy coconut-infused sticky rice make it a perfect treat for any time of year. The traditional version is already pretty close to being vegan, as it mostly consists of rice, mango, and coconut milk. However, in some recipes, dairy might sneak in, especially in the coconut sauce. This vegan version eliminates any animal-derived ingredients, making it completely plant-based.</p><p>What’s so special about this dish is its balance of textures and flavors. The sticky rice is soft, chewy, and slightly sweet, while the coconut sauce brings an extra layer of richness and flavor. The fresh mango adds a natural sweetness and a refreshing burst of flavor. When you take a bite, it’s like you’ve been transported to a tropical paradise, and the combination of creamy, sweet, and slightly salty flavors will have you coming back for more.</p><h3 id=key-ingredients-youll-need>Key Ingredients You’ll Need</h3><p>To make vegan mango sticky rice, you&rsquo;ll only need a handful of ingredients. Here’s a rundown of what you’ll need to create this tropical dessert:</p><h4 id=for-the-sticky-rice>For the Sticky Rice:</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Glutinous rice (also called sticky rice or sweet rice)</strong> – This rice is key to creating that soft, chewy texture. Unlike regular rice, glutinous rice has a higher starch content that makes it sticky and perfect for this dessert. It’s often used in Southeast Asian dishes and is available in most supermarkets or Asian grocery stores.</p></li><li><p><strong>Coconut milk</strong> – Coconut milk adds richness and creaminess to the sticky rice. This is what makes the rice creamy and gives it that delicious coconut flavor. Make sure to use full-fat coconut milk for the best results.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sugar</strong> – A little sugar is added to sweeten the rice. You can use white sugar or opt for coconut sugar for a more natural, caramel-like sweetness. You could also experiment with maple syrup or agave nectar if you want a different sweetener.</p></li><li><p><strong>Salt</strong> – A pinch of salt helps balance the sweetness and bring out the flavors in the coconut milk and rice.</p></li></ol><h4 id=for-the-mango>For the Mango:</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Ripe mangoes</strong> – Fresh, ripe mangoes are essential for this dessert. They should be sweet and juicy, with a smooth, soft texture. Choose mangoes that are fragrant and have slightly wrinkled skin to ensure they’re perfectly ripe.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lime (optional)</strong> – A squeeze of fresh lime juice can add a hint of tanginess that enhances the natural sweetness of the mangoes.</p></li></ol><h4 id=for-garnishing>For Garnishing:</h4><ol><li><p><strong>Sesame seeds (optional)</strong> – Toasted sesame seeds can be sprinkled on top for a little crunch and extra flavor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Coconut flakes (optional)</strong> – Shredded coconut is another optional garnish that complements the coconut milk used in the sticky rice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mint leaves (optional)</strong> – Fresh mint leaves can provide a refreshing, herbaceous contrast to the rich coconut flavors.</p></li></ol><p>Now that we have our ingredients ready, let’s dive into the simple process of making this delightful vegan dessert!</p><h2 id=step-by-step-recipe-for-vegan-mango-sticky-rice>Step-by-Step Recipe for Vegan Mango Sticky Rice</h2><p>Making mango sticky rice is quite simple, and it doesn’t take much time at all! Here&rsquo;s how to make this tropical treat from scratch.</p><h3 id=step-1-preparing-the-sticky-rice>Step 1: Preparing the Sticky Rice</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Rinse the Rice</strong> – Start by thoroughly rinsing the glutinous rice under cold water. You want to remove excess starch from the rice so that it cooks evenly. Rinse until the water runs clear.</p></li><li><p><strong>Soak the Rice</strong> – After rinsing, soak the glutinous rice in water for about 1 to 2 hours. Soaking the rice allows it to cook properly and achieve that signature sticky texture.</p></li><li><p><strong>Steam the Rice</strong> – Once the rice is soaked, drain the water and steam the rice. You can use a traditional bamboo steamer or a regular metal steamer basket. Cover the rice with a clean cloth to keep the steam from escaping. Steam for about 20 to 30 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and tender. Make sure to check on it halfway through to ensure it’s not sticking to the steamer.</p></li></ol><h3 id=step-2-making-the-coconut-sauce>Step 2: Making the Coconut Sauce</h3><p>While the rice is steaming, you can make the creamy coconut sauce that will be poured over the sticky rice.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Combine the Coconut Milk, Sugar, and Salt</strong> – In a small saucepan, combine the full-fat coconut milk, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Stir the mixture over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved completely. Be sure not to let it boil, as it can curdle. You just want it to warm up and blend together into a smooth, creamy sauce.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simmer the Sauce</strong> – Once the sugar is dissolved, reduce the heat and let the coconut milk mixture simmer for another 5 to 10 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent it from burning. You’ll know the sauce is ready when it thickens slightly and has a rich, smooth consistency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add to the Rice</strong> – Once the rice is done steaming, transfer it to a large mixing bowl. Pour the coconut sauce over the rice and stir gently to combine. Let the rice sit for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. The rice should soak up the creamy coconut sauce, becoming soft and velvety.</p></li></ol><h3 id=step-3-preparing-the-mangoes>Step 3: Preparing the Mangoes</h3><p>While the sticky rice is resting with the coconut sauce, it’s time to prepare the mangoes.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Peel the Mangoes</strong> – Using a sharp knife, peel the mangoes and remove the pit. To do this, cut along the sides of the pit to get two large mango halves. Then slice the mango flesh into thin strips or cubes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Arrange the Mangoes</strong> – Once you’ve sliced the mangoes, arrange them artfully on a serving plate or bowl. You can create a fan shape with the slices for a more elegant presentation.</p></li></ol><h3 id=step-4-assemble-the-mango-sticky-rice>Step 4: Assemble the Mango Sticky Rice</h3><p>Now that everything is ready, it’s time to assemble the dessert!</p><ol><li><p><strong>Serve the Sticky Rice</strong> – Spoon a generous portion of the coconut sticky rice onto each plate. Be sure to serve the rice while it’s still warm or at room temperature for the best experience.</p></li><li><p><strong>Top with Mango Slices</strong> – Place the mango slices on top or beside the sticky rice, depending on your presentation style. The bright yellow mangoes will add a pop of color and a burst of tropical flavor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Garnish (Optional)</strong> – If you like, you can garnish your vegan mango sticky rice with a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds, shredded coconut flakes, or fresh mint leaves. These garnishes add a little extra flair and texture to your dish.</p></li></ol><h3 id=step-5-enjoy>Step 5: Enjoy!</h3><p>Once everything is assembled, dig in and enjoy this sweet, creamy, and tropical dessert. The contrast between the rich, coconut-infused sticky rice and the juicy, fragrant mango slices is simply irresistible.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-perfect-vegan-mango-sticky-rice>Tips for the Perfect Vegan Mango Sticky Rice</h2><p>While the recipe is simple, here are a few tips to ensure your vegan mango sticky rice turns out perfectly every time:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Use Fresh, Ripe Mangoes</strong> – The key to a great mango sticky rice is using ripe mangoes. Make sure your mangoes are soft, fragrant, and sweet. If they’re underripe, they’ll be too sour and tough, which can ruin the dish.</p></li><li><p><strong>Let the Rice Soak Up the Coconut Milk</strong> – After steaming the rice and adding the coconut sauce, allow the rice to sit for a few minutes so it can fully absorb the coconut milk. This will ensure every grain of rice is flavored and creamy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adjust the Sweetness</strong> – Depending on your taste preferences, you can adjust the amount of sugar you add to the rice and the coconut sauce. If you prefer a less sweet dessert, reduce the sugar in the coconut sauce.</p></li><li><p><strong>Serve Immediately</strong> – Mango sticky rice is best served fresh, while the rice is still warm and the mangoes are ripe. However, if you have leftovers, you can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a couple of days. Just keep in mind that the texture of the rice may change once it’s chilled.</p></li></ol><h2 id=why-youll-love-vegan-mango-sticky-rice>Why You’ll Love Vegan Mango Sticky Rice</h2><p>This vegan mango sticky rice recipe is the perfect blend of sweet, creamy, and tropical flavors.
