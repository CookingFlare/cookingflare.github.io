When working with fruits, proper selection and storage are vital for maximizing flavor in your desserts.

This not only benefits your local economy but also ensures freshness and taste.</p><p>Look for Ripeness: Examine fruits carefully; they should smell fragrant, have vibrant colors, and not be overly soft or bruised.</p><p>Proper Storage: Store fruits correctly to prolong their freshness. Most berries are best kept in the refrigerator, while fruits like peaches and apples are best at room temperature until ripe.</p><p>Conclusion: Embracing the Beauty of Seasonal Fruits
