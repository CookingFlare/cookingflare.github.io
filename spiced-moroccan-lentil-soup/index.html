Prepare the Ingredients</h3><p>Begin by rinsing and draining the lentils, removing any debris or stones. Set them aside. Dice the onions, carrots, and garlic, and have the other ingredients ready to go. This soup is incredibly simple to make, but a little prep work will make the cooking process smooth and efficient.</p><h3 id=2-sauté-the-vegetables>2. Sauté the Vegetables</h3><p>In a large soup pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté for about 5 minutes until softened and translucent. Then, add the minced garlic and carrots and cook for an additional 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. The aromatics will begin to fill your kitchen with their rich scent, signaling that you’re on the right track.</p><h3 id=3-add-the-spices>3. Add the Spices</h3><p>Once the vegetables are tender, it’s time to add the spices. Sprinkle in the cumin, coriander, turmeric, cinnamon, paprika, ginger, and cloves (if using). Stir the mixture for about 1 minute to allow the spices to bloom and release their fragrances. This step is essential for bringing out the depth of flavor that makes Moroccan cuisine so memorable.</p><h3 id=4-add-tomatoes-and-broth>4. Add Tomatoes and Broth</h3><p>Next, pour in the diced tomatoes (with their juices) and stir to combine with the spices and vegetables. The tomatoes add a nice tang and acidity, balancing the richness of the spices. After a minute or two, pour in the vegetable broth, followed by the rinsed lentils and bay leaf. Give everything a good stir, making sure the lentils are submerged in the liquid.</p><h3 id=5-simmer-the-soup>5. Simmer the Soup</h3><p>Bring the soup to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the soup simmer gently for 30-40 minutes, or until the lentils are tender and cooked through. Stir occasionally, checking to ensure the lentils are cooking evenly. If the soup becomes too thick, you can add a little more broth or water to reach your desired consistency.</p><h3 id=6-season-to-taste>6. Season to Taste</h3><p>Once the lentils are soft and the soup has thickened into a comforting, stew-like consistency, taste and adjust the seasoning. Add salt and pepper to taste, and if you like a touch of sweetness, you can stir in a tablespoon of honey or maple syrup to balance the spices. The sweetness complements the earthy flavors of the lentils and the warmth of the spices beautifully.</p><h3 id=7-add-fresh-lemon-juice>7. Add Fresh Lemon Juice</h3><p>To finish the soup, squeeze in the juice of one fresh lemon. The acidity from the lemon brightens the dish and adds a refreshing contrast to the warm, spiced flavors. Stir well and let the soup sit for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</p><h3 id=8-serve-and-garnish>8. Serve and Garnish</h3><p>Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh cilantro, a dollop of yogurt (if using), and any other garnishes you desire. Toasted almonds or pine nuts add a delightful crunch, while fresh herbs like parsley or mint provide an extra layer of freshness.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfecting-your-moroccan-lentil-soup>Tips for Perfecting Your Moroccan Lentil Soup</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Adjust the spice level</strong>: If you prefer a spicier soup, feel free to add a pinch of cayenne pepper or a chopped chili to the pot. Conversely, if you&rsquo;re sensitive to heat, you can reduce or omit the paprika and cayenne pepper entirely.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it your own</strong>: This soup is incredibly versatile. You can add other vegetables, such as sweet potatoes, zucchini, or bell peppers, to suit your taste. You could also add a handful of spinach or kale during the last few minutes of cooking for an extra dose of greens.</p></li><li><p><strong>Storage</strong>: This soup stores well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. It also freezes beautifully, so you can make a large batch and freeze individual portions for later use. Just be sure to cool the soup completely before storing it in airtight containers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it a meal</strong>: Serve the soup with some crusty bread, couscous, or a side salad to make it a more substantial meal. A scoop of tangy yogurt on top adds creaminess and a burst of flavor that complements the spices in the soup.</p></li></ul><h2 id=health-benefits-of-spiced-moroccan-lentil-soup>Health Benefits of Spiced Moroccan Lentil Soup</h2><p>This Spiced Moroccan Lentil Soup isn’t just delicious—it’s packed with health benefits.
