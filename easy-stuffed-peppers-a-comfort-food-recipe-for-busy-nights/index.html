Slice off the tops and remove the seeds and membranes. You can either discard the tops or chop them up to add to the filling later. Make sure to trim the bottoms of the peppers so they stand upright in the baking dish. If the peppers are wobbly, carefully slice a thin layer off the bottom to stabilize them.</p><h4 id=step-2-cook-the-filling>Step 2: Cook the Filling</h4><p>In a large skillet, heat a tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until they become soft and fragrant. Add the ground meat of your choice to the pan, breaking it apart with a spoon. Cook the meat until it is browned and cooked through.</p><p>Next, stir in the cooked rice, diced tomatoes, tomato sauce, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Let everything simmer together for 5-7 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. The mixture should be thick and flavorful. Taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.</p><h4 id=step-3-stuff-the-peppers>Step 3: Stuff the Peppers</h4><p>Once the filling is ready, it’s time to stuff the peppers. Spoon the mixture into each bell pepper, packing the filling tightly so it’s well-stuffed. If you have any leftover filling, you can bake it in a small oven-safe dish alongside the peppers.</p><h4 id=step-4-bake-the-stuffed-peppers>Step 4: Bake the Stuffed Peppers</h4><p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the stuffed peppers in a baking dish, standing upright. If desired, pour a little extra tomato sauce or marinara over the tops of the peppers for added moisture and flavor. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the peppers are tender.</p><h4 id=step-5-add-cheese-and-finish-baking>Step 5: Add Cheese and Finish Baking</h4><p>After 30-35 minutes, remove the foil and sprinkle the shredded cheese over the tops of the peppers. Return the dish to the oven and bake uncovered for an additional 5-10 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</p><h4 id=step-6-serve-and-enjoy>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h4><p>Once the peppers are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. Garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or basil for a pop of color and flavor. Serve your stuffed peppers with a side salad, roasted vegetables, or a slice of crusty bread for a complete meal.</p><h3 id=tips-for-perfect-stuffed-peppers>Tips for Perfect Stuffed Peppers</h3><p>To ensure that your stuffed peppers turn out perfectly every time, here are a few helpful tips:</p><ol><li><strong>Choose the Right Peppers</strong>: Bell peppers come in different colors and sizes. Opt for large, firm peppers that can hold a lot of filling. If you can’t find large peppers, you can use smaller ones and make individual servings.</li><li><strong>Cook the Rice Ahead of Time</strong>: Cooking rice can take a while, so to speed up the process, make sure the rice is ready before you start preparing the filling. You can also use leftover rice from another meal.</li><li><strong>Add Extra Veggies</strong>: Want to boost the nutrition? Add chopped zucchini, mushrooms, or spinach to the filling mixture. These vegetables pair well with the other ingredients and will add flavor and texture.</li><li><strong>Use Ground Meat Alternatives</strong>: If you prefer a lighter meal, substitute ground turkey or chicken for ground beef. For a vegetarian option, try using plant-based meat substitutes, or even beans like black beans or lentils.</li><li><strong>Make It Low-Carb</strong>: Swap the rice for cauliflower rice or another low-carb alternative. This keeps the dish filling without the extra carbs.</li><li><strong>Adjust the Spices</strong>: Feel free to customize the seasoning in the filling. Add chili flakes for a little heat, or experiment with different herbs and spices like cumin, paprika, or thyme.</li></ol><h3 id=variations-on-stuffed-peppers>Variations on Stuffed Peppers</h3><p>While this recipe is already delicious on its own, there are plenty of variations you can try to keep things interesting.</p><ul><li><strong>Mexican Stuffed Peppers</strong>: Add black beans, corn, cumin, and chili powder to the filling for a Mexican-inspired twist. Top with sour cream, guacamole, and salsa when serving.</li><li><strong>Italian Stuffed Peppers</strong>: Use Italian sausage or ground beef, and stir in marinara sauce, fresh basil, and oregano. Top with mozzarella cheese and serve with a side of garlic bread.</li><li><strong>Breakfast Stuffed Peppers</strong>: For a fun breakfast twist, use scrambled eggs, bacon, and cheese as the filling. You can even add some sautéed spinach or onions for extra flavor.</li><li><strong>Vegetarian Stuffed Peppers</strong>: Instead of meat, use a combination of quinoa, black beans, diced tomatoes, and your favorite spices. Top with cheese (or a dairy-free alternative) for a satisfying vegetarian meal.</li></ul><h3 id=meal-prep-and-storage>Meal Prep and Storage</h3><p>Stuffed peppers are perfect for meal prepping because they store and reheat so well. Once your stuffed peppers are baked, allow them to cool completely before storing them in an airtight container. They’ll keep in the refrigerator for 3-4 days, making them a great option for a week of quick meals.</p><p>To reheat, place the stuffed peppers in the microwave or oven until warmed through. If reheating in the oven, cover them with foil to prevent the peppers from drying out.</p><h3 id=why-stuffed-peppers-are-perfect-for-busy-nights>Why Stuffed Peppers Are Perfect for Busy Nights</h3><p>Life can get hectic, and sometimes you just need a meal that doesn’t take hours to prepare but still feels like a home-cooked dish.
