Central to any Korean meal are the side dishes, known as <em>banchan</em>. These small, flavorful dishes are served alongside the main course, complementing the primary dish and providing a range of tastes and textures to create a well-rounded meal. If you’ve ever had the pleasure of dining at a Korean restaurant or sharing a meal with Korean friends, you&rsquo;ve likely been introduced to the concept of <em>banchan</em>. But for many, there’s a whole world of lesser-known side dishes beyond the staples like kimchi and pickled vegetables. In this post, we’ll take you through some of the best and most interesting Korean side dishes you need to try.</p><h2 id=1-kimchi-김치>1. Kimchi (김치)</h2><p>Let’s start with the iconic and the most well-known of Korean side dishes—kimchi. While it’s not new to many, there’s much more to kimchi than meets the eye. Traditionally, kimchi is fermented vegetables, typically napa cabbage or radishes, seasoned with chili flakes, garlic, ginger, and a host of other ingredients. While the most common version is made from napa cabbage, there are many variations based on the vegetables used, as well as the specific seasoning paste. <em>Kimchi</em> undergoes fermentation, which enhances its flavors and makes it both tangy and spicy.</p><p>What makes kimchi unique is its fermentation process, which not only gives it its characteristic flavor but also offers health benefits. Fermented foods like kimchi are packed with probiotics, which promote healthy digestion and contribute to overall gut health. A bowl of rice topped with kimchi is a simple, yet perfect combination in Korean cuisine.</p><h2 id=2-japchae-잡채>2. Japchae (잡채)</h2><p>Next on the list is <em>japchae</em>, a savory and slightly sweet dish made from stir-fried glass noodles. The noodles used in japchae are made from sweet potato starch, which gives them a chewy and bouncy texture. This dish is made by stir-frying the noodles with a variety of vegetables such as spinach, carrots, onions, and mushrooms, along with sliced beef or sometimes pork. The key to the flavor lies in the sauce—soy sauce, sesame oil, and a touch of sugar combine to give japchae its unique taste.</p><p>Japchae is a versatile dish and can be served hot or cold, often enjoyed as a side dish at celebrations, including birthdays and holidays. It can also stand alone as a light, satisfying meal. Because of its sweet, savory, and slightly smoky flavors, japchae is loved by people of all ages.</p><h2 id=3-banchan-assortment-반찬-모음>3. Banchan Assortment (반찬 모음)</h2><p>While <em>banchan</em> refers to any Korean side dish, in some contexts, it specifically denotes a variety of small plates served together as a set. A typical <em>banchan</em> assortment might include a mix of pickled vegetables, marinated beansprouts, spinach seasoned with sesame oil, fried tofu, kimchi, and more. These dishes are meant to be shared among the table, encouraging communal dining.</p><p>A well-prepared <em>banchan</em> assortment showcases the diversity of Korean flavors. Some banchan are spicy, some are savory, and others are tangy, offering an array of textures, from crunchy pickles to soft tofu. The balance between sweet, salty, sour, and umami is one of the key characteristics of Korean cuisine.</p><h2 id=4-kongnamul-muchim-콩나물-무침>4. Kongnamul Muchim (콩나물 무침)</h2><p><em>Kongnamul muchim</em> is a simple yet delicious Korean side dish made with soybean sprouts. Soybean sprouts are lightly blanched, and then mixed with a flavorful dressing made from sesame oil, garlic, green onions, and a touch of gochugaru (Korean chili flakes). The dish is seasoned to bring out the natural nutty flavor of the soybeans, and a sprinkle of sesame seeds adds the perfect touch of crunch.</p><p>This side dish is commonly found in Korean households and restaurants due to its easy preparation and healthy ingredients. Soybean sprouts are rich in protein and vitamins, making <em>kongnamul muchim</em> a nutritious choice to complement heavier dishes. The light, crisp texture of the soybeans pairs perfectly with the richness of Korean main dishes, making it a favorite <em>banchan</em> for any meal.</p><h2 id=5-oi-muchim-오이-무침>5. Oi Muchim (오이 무침)</h2><p><em>Oi muchim</em> is a refreshing and tangy cucumber side dish that’s often served as a counterbalance to spicy Korean foods. Thinly sliced cucumbers are mixed with a flavorful sauce made from vinegar, sugar, garlic, gochugaru, and a bit of sesame oil. This side dish is a great addition to any meal, providing a cool, crisp texture that contrasts with the heat of other dishes.</p><p>What makes <em>oi muchim</em> especially refreshing is the balance of sweetness and sourness, which is achieved through the vinegar and sugar. Additionally, the natural crunch of the cucumbers makes it a delightful dish to enjoy alongside rice, meats, or even as an appetizer on its own.</p><h2 id=6-jangajji-장아찌>6. Jangajji (장아찌)</h2><p><em>Jangajji</em> refers to pickled vegetables in Korean cuisine, often pickled with soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and chili peppers. Popular vegetables for <em>jangajji</em> include radishes, garlic, cucumbers, and green chili peppers. These vegetables are preserved in a tangy, salty brine that makes for a flavorful and addictive side dish.</p><p>Jangajji is a great way to preserve seasonal vegetables, and its sharp, piquant flavor serves as the perfect contrast to rich, savory dishes like grilled meats or stews. The pickling process not only enhances the flavor of the vegetables but also extends their shelf life, allowing families to enjoy them throughout the year.</p><h2 id=7-gaji-namul-가지-나물>7. Gaji Namul (가지 나물)</h2><p>Eggplant is a popular vegetable in Korean cuisine, and <em>gaji namul</em> is a seasoned eggplant side dish that is both flavorful and comforting. The eggplant is lightly sautéed and then seasoned with a mixture of garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, and sometimes gochugaru. It’s typically served at room temperature, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p><p>The texture of the eggplant in <em>gaji namul</em> is tender and soft, making it a great dish to enjoy alongside grilled meats or stews. This side dish offers a mild yet savory taste, with the sesame oil adding a nutty, fragrant flavor that elevates the eggplant’s natural sweetness.</p><h2 id=8-kimchi-jeon-김치전>8. Kimchi Jeon (김치전)</h2><p>A beloved Korean savory pancake, <em>kimchi jeon</em> is made with a batter that’s fried until crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The batter typically includes flour, water, and egg, and it’s mixed with chopped kimchi, green onions, and sometimes bits of pork or seafood. The fermentation of the kimchi infuses the pancake with a tangy flavor that complements the crispy edges.</p><p><em>Kimchi jeon</em> is a versatile dish that can be enjoyed as a side dish, snack, or appetizer. It’s often served with a soy sauce dipping sauce, and its satisfying texture makes it a favorite comfort food among Koreans. When served hot off the pan, it’s an irresistible addition to any meal.</p><h2 id=9-mu-doenjang-무된장>9. Mu-Doenjang (무된장)</h2><p>For something hearty and comforting, <em>mu-doenjang</em> is a traditional Korean side dish made from radish and fermented soybean paste (doenjang). The radish is cut into thick slices and simmered in a broth made from the soybean paste, garlic, and a variety of seasonings. The dish has a savory, earthy flavor, with the richness of the doenjang providing depth and complexity.</p><p><em>Mu-doenjang</em> is often served as a warm side dish during colder months, as its warming qualities make it especially comforting.

Banchan with Tofu (두부 반찬)</h2><p>Tofu is a versatile ingredient in Korean cuisine, and it often makes an appearance in <em>banchan</em>. Tofu is usually served in one of two ways—either as a steamed or lightly fried dish. One popular method of preparing tofu for <em>banchan</em> is to slice it into cubes and sauté it with garlic, soy sauce, and sesame oil. The tofu soaks up the seasonings and becomes soft and flavorful. It is often topped with sesame seeds and chopped green onions for an extra layer of flavor.</p><p>The lightness of tofu makes it a perfect accompaniment to heavier, richer dishes, helping to balance out the meal. Additionally, tofu is packed with protein and is a great vegetarian-friendly option for <em>banchan</em>.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Korean cuisine offers a wide array of delicious side dishes, each with its own distinct flavors, textures, and ingredients.
