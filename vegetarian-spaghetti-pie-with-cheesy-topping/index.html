This recipe serves about 6-8 people, so it’s perfect for feeding a crowd or having leftovers for lunch the next day. Here&rsquo;s what you’ll need:</p><h3 id=for-the-pie-filling>For the Pie Filling:</h3><ul><li>1 package (about 12 oz) of spaghetti (whole wheat, gluten-free, or regular)</li><li>1 tablespoon olive oil (for sautéing)</li><li>1 medium onion, chopped</li><li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>1 zucchini, diced</li><li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li><li>1 cup fresh spinach, chopped (or substitute with kale or Swiss chard)</li><li>1 can (14.5 oz) crushed tomatoes</li><li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li><li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li><li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li><li>1/2 cup ricotta cheese (or use cottage cheese for a lower-fat version)</li><li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese (plus extra for topping)</li><li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li><li>2 large eggs (for binding)</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-cheesy-topping>For the Cheesy Topping:</h3><ul><li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li><li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li><li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil (optional for garnish)</li></ul><h2 id=step-by-step-instructions-for-making-vegetarian-spaghetti-pie>Step-by-Step Instructions for Making Vegetarian Spaghetti Pie</h2><h3 id=step-1-cook-the-spaghetti>Step 1: Cook the Spaghetti</h3><p>Start by boiling a large pot of salted water. Add your spaghetti and cook according to the package directions until al dente, usually about 8-10 minutes. Drain the pasta and set it aside.</p><h3 id=step-2-sauté-the-vegetables>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3><p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until it becomes translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Then, add the garlic and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</p><p>Next, toss in the diced zucchini and bell pepper. Sauté the vegetables until they soften, which should take about 5-7 minutes. Add the chopped spinach last, and cook until it wilts down, about 2 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, dried oregano, and dried basil.</p><h3 id=step-3-prepare-the-sauce>Step 3: Prepare the Sauce</h3><p>Once the vegetables are tender, pour in the crushed tomatoes and stir to combine. Allow the mixture to simmer on low heat for 5-10 minutes to let the flavors meld together. Taste and adjust seasoning as necessary.</p><h3 id=step-4-mix-the-spaghetti-filling>Step 4: Mix the Spaghetti Filling</h3><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooked spaghetti with the vegetable-tomato sauce mixture. Add the ricotta cheese, shredded mozzarella, grated Parmesan, and the eggs. Mix everything well, ensuring the pasta is evenly coated with the cheesy sauce. The eggs will help bind the mixture and give the pie its structure once baked.</p><h3 id=step-5-assemble-the-spaghetti-pie>Step 5: Assemble the Spaghetti Pie</h3><p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9-inch pie dish or a round baking pan with a bit of olive oil or cooking spray. Transfer the spaghetti mixture into the prepared dish, spreading it out evenly.</p><h3 id=step-6-add-the-cheesy-topping>Step 6: Add the Cheesy Topping</h3><p>Sprinkle the top of the spaghetti pie with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. This will create a delicious, golden crust as the pie bakes. If desired, sprinkle a bit of chopped fresh basil on top for extra flavor and color.</p><h3 id=step-7-bake-the-pie>Step 7: Bake the Pie</h3><p>Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese on top is melted and bubbly, and the edges of the pie start to turn golden brown. If you want an extra crispy topping, broil the pie for an additional 1-2 minutes, but keep a close eye on it to avoid burning.</p><h3 id=step-8-let-the-pie-cool-before-serving>Step 8: Let the Pie Cool Before Serving</h3><p>Once baked, remove the spaghetti pie from the oven and let it cool for about 5 minutes. This will make it easier to slice and serve. Cut the pie into wedges, and serve it as a main dish for dinner or as a side to complement other Italian-inspired recipes.</p><h2 id=tips-for-making-the-perfect-vegetarian-spaghetti-pie>Tips for Making the Perfect Vegetarian Spaghetti Pie</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Add Extra Veggies:</strong> The beauty of spaghetti pie is that you can easily customize it with additional vegetables. Mushrooms, eggplant, or even roasted sweet potatoes work wonderfully in this dish. If you’re trying to pack in more veggies, feel free to experiment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it Gluten-Free:</strong> If you follow a gluten-free diet, simply substitute regular spaghetti with gluten-free pasta. There are plenty of great gluten-free pasta options available that will work just as well in this recipe.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Dairy-Free Cheese:</strong> For a dairy-free or vegan option, swap out the ricotta and mozzarella for plant-based cheese alternatives. There are many delicious vegan cheeses available that melt well, so your spaghetti pie will still be cheesy and satisfying.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prep Ahead:</strong> You can prepare the pie ahead of time by assembling it the day before. Just cover it tightly with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store it in the fridge. When you&rsquo;re ready to bake, remove it from the fridge and follow the baking instructions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Freezing the Pie:</strong> Spaghetti pie also freezes incredibly well. If you have leftovers or want to make extra to enjoy later, allow the pie to cool completely, then wrap it tightly and freeze it for up to 3 months. When ready to eat, simply bake it from frozen or thaw it in the fridge overnight before reheating.</p></li></ul><h2 id=serving-suggestions>Serving Suggestions</h2><p>Vegetarian spaghetti pie is a hearty meal on its own, but you can pair it with a variety of sides to complete the meal. Here are some ideas for what to serve alongside your spaghetti pie:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Garlic Bread or Crusty Bread:</strong> A side of warm, crusty bread is always a welcome addition to pasta dishes. It’s perfect for mopping up any extra sauce left on your plate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Simple Green Salad:</strong> A fresh salad with a light vinaigrette can balance out the richness of the cheesy spaghetti pie. Opt for mixed greens, arugula, or baby spinach, and add a few slices of cucumber or cherry tomatoes for extra crunch.</p></li><li><p><strong>Roasted Vegetables:</strong> Roasting a mix of vegetables like carrots, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts brings out their natural sweetness and creates a great contrast to the savory pie.</p></li></ul><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Vegetarian spaghetti pie with cheesy topping is an absolute crowd-pleaser that is guaranteed to satisfy both vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. It’s a comforting and hearty dish that’s easy to make and perfect for any occasion. Whether you&rsquo;re serving it as a family dinner, preparing it for a potluck, or simply enjoying a cozy meal at home, this recipe will become a staple in your meal rotation.</p><p>The best part is that it’s highly adaptable.
