With just a few basic pantry staples and a little time in the kitchen, you&rsquo;ll have golden, cheesy breadsticks that are perfect for any occasion. Here’s what you’ll need:</p><h3 id=ingredients>Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li><li>1 tablespoon sugar</li><li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li><li>1 teaspoon salt</li><li>3/4 cup warm water (about 110°F or 43°C)</li><li>2 tablespoons olive oil (plus extra for brushing)</li><li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li><li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li><li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano (optional)</li><li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li><li>1 egg (for egg wash)</li></ul><p>These ingredients are all commonly found in most kitchens, which makes this recipe both affordable and accessible.

Feel free to experiment with different herbs, spices, or cheese variations.</p><h2 id=step-by-step-guide-to-making-parmesan-breadsticks>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Parmesan Breadsticks</h2><h3 id=step-1-activating-the-yeast>Step 1: Activating the Yeast</h3><p>The first step in making these Parmesan breadsticks is to activate the yeast. This is an important step because it ensures that your breadsticks will rise and become light and fluffy.</p><ul><li>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and active dry yeast. Stir gently to dissolve the sugar and yeast.</li><li>Let the mixture sit for about 5 to 10 minutes, until it becomes foamy. If it doesn’t foam, your yeast may be expired or the water might have been too hot or too cold. Try again with fresh yeast and the correct water temperature.</li></ul><h3 id=step-2-mixing-the-dough>Step 2: Mixing the Dough</h3><p>Once the yeast is activated, it’s time to combine the dry ingredients. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour and salt. Then, add the yeast mixture, olive oil, and one tablespoon of Parmesan cheese.</p><ul><li>Stir the mixture with a spoon until it begins to form a dough. Once the dough starts to come together, knead it on a lightly floured surface for about 5 minutes. The dough should be smooth and elastic. If it’s too sticky, add a little more flour, but be careful not to overdo it. You want a soft, slightly tacky dough.</li></ul><h3 id=step-3-letting-the-dough-rise>Step 3: Letting the Dough Rise</h3><p>Now that your dough is kneaded, it&rsquo;s time for it to rise. This step is crucial for creating light and airy breadsticks.</p><ul><li>Lightly oil a large bowl and place the dough inside. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap.</li><li>Allow the dough to rise in a warm spot for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size. This is a good time to preheat your oven.</li></ul><h3 id=step-4-prepping-the-oven-and-baking-sheets>Step 4: Prepping the Oven and Baking Sheets</h3><p>While the dough is rising, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Prepare your baking sheets by lining them with parchment paper. This ensures that your breadsticks will bake evenly and won’t stick to the pan.</p><p>If you prefer extra crispy breadsticks, you can also lightly oil the parchment paper before placing the dough on it.</p><h3 id=step-5-shaping-the-breadsticks>Step 5: Shaping the Breadsticks</h3><p>Once the dough has risen, punch it down gently to release the air bubbles. Then, transfer the dough to a floured surface and roll it out into a rectangle shape, about 1/2 inch thick. Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to slice the dough into strips—about 1 inch wide and 6 inches long.</p><ul><li>If you want to get creative, you can twist the strips into spirals or make longer breadsticks by cutting fewer, wider strips.</li></ul><p>Place the shaped breadsticks on the prepared baking sheet, leaving a little space between each one for expansion.</p><h3 id=step-6-egg-wash-and-topping>Step 6: Egg Wash and Topping</h3><p>To give your breadsticks that irresistible golden-brown shine, brush them with an egg wash before baking. For the egg wash, beat the egg and brush it over the top of each breadstick using a pastry brush.</p><ul><li>After applying the egg wash, sprinkle each breadstick with grated Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and dried oregano (if using). You can also add a pinch of freshly ground black pepper to enhance the flavor further.</li></ul><h3 id=step-7-baking-the-breadsticks>Step 7: Baking the Breadsticks</h3><p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the breadsticks for about 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy on the edges. Keep an eye on them, as oven temperatures can vary.</p><p>Once the breadsticks are done, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet. This gives the breadsticks time to firm up and makes them easier to handle.</p><h3 id=step-8-serving-your-parmesan-breadsticks>Step 8: Serving Your Parmesan Breadsticks</h3><p>Your Parmesan breadsticks are now ready to be enjoyed! Serve them warm with your favorite dipping sauces, such as marinara, ranch, or even a simple garlic butter. These breadsticks are also fantastic on their own, as their flavor is rich and satisfying.</p><p>If you’re looking for a fun twist, you can serve these breadsticks alongside a pasta dish or pair them with a fresh salad. They are perfect for family dinners, parties, or even a cozy night in.</p><h2 id=tips-for-making-the-best-parmesan-breadsticks>Tips for Making the Best Parmesan Breadsticks</h2><p>While this recipe is straightforward, there are a few tips and tricks to ensure your Parmesan breadsticks come out perfectly every time:</p><h3 id=1-use-fresh-ingredients>1. Use Fresh Ingredients</h3><p>Fresh yeast and quality Parmesan cheese will make all the difference in your breadsticks. Fresh yeast activates better and gives the dough a more consistent rise, while good-quality Parmesan adds a sharp, nutty flavor that’s hard to beat.</p><h3 id=2-knead-the-dough-properly>2. Knead the Dough Properly</h3><p>Don’t rush through the kneading process. Kneading helps develop the gluten in the dough, which gives the breadsticks their chewy texture. Make sure to knead the dough for at least 5 minutes, or until it’s smooth and elastic.</p><h3 id=3-experiment-with-seasonings>3. Experiment with Seasonings</h3><p>If you want to add a little extra flair to your breadsticks, feel free to experiment with different herbs and spices. Some popular additions include crushed red pepper flakes, basil, thyme, or even a sprinkle of Italian seasoning. You can also use a mixture of different cheeses, like mozzarella or cheddar, to vary the flavor.</p><h3 id=4-use-room-temperature-water>4. Use Room Temperature Water</h3><p>When activating the yeast, make sure the water temperature is just right. Water that is too hot can kill the yeast, while water that’s too cold will not activate it properly. Aim for water that’s warm to the touch but not scalding—about 110°F (43°C) is perfect.</p><h3 id=5-dont-skip-the-egg-wash>5. Don’t Skip the Egg Wash</h3><p>The egg wash gives your Parmesan breadsticks that signature golden-brown crust. While it’s tempting to skip this step, it really enhances the overall appearance and texture of the breadsticks.</p><h3 id=6-store-leftovers-properly>6. Store Leftovers Properly</h3><p>If you happen to have any leftover breadsticks (which is rare!), store them in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. For longer storage, wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and freeze them for up to 3 months. To reheat, bake them in the oven at 350°F (175°C) for about 5 minutes.</p><h2 id=why-youll-love-these-parmesan-breadsticks>Why You’ll Love These Parmesan Breadsticks</h2><p>These Parmesan breadsticks are not only easy to make, but they are also incredibly versatile.
