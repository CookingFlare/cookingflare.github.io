Sprinkle the yeast over the top and let it sit for about 5–10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This indicates that the yeast is active.</li></ol><h4 id=step-2-mix-the-dough>Step 2: Mix the Dough</h4><ol start=2><li><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and spices (if using). Create a well in the center and add the softened butter, eggs, lemon zest, vanilla extract, and the frothy yeast mixture.</p></li><li><p>Mix the ingredients together until a dough forms. You may need to add a little more flour if the dough is too sticky.</p></li></ol><h4 id=step-3-knead-the-dough>Step 3: Knead the Dough</h4><ol start=4><li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 8–10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic. This process helps develop the gluten in the flour, resulting in a better texture.</li></ol><h4 id=step-4-first-rise>Step 4: First Rise</h4><ol start=5><li>Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a greased bowl. Cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm place for about 1–2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li></ol><h4 id=step-5-shape-the-bread>Step 5: Shape the Bread</h4><ol start=6><li><p>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Divide the dough into three equal portions for a braided loaf or leave it whole for a round shape.</p></li><li><p>If braiding, roll each portion into a long rope and braid them together. If making a round loaf, shape the dough into a ball and place it in a greased round baking pan.</p></li></ol><h4 id=step-6-second-rise>Step 6: Second Rise</h4><ol start=8><li>Cover the shaped dough with a towel and let it rise again for about 30–45 minutes or until it has puffed up.</li></ol><h4 id=step-7-preheat-the-oven>Step 7: Preheat the Oven</h4><ol start=9><li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) while the dough is rising.</li></ol><h4 id=step-8-prepare-the-egg-wash>Step 8: Prepare the Egg Wash</h4><ol start=10><li>In a small bowl, whisk together the beaten egg and milk. Brush this mixture over the top of the risen dough for a beautiful golden crust.</li></ol><h4 id=step-9-bake>Step 9: Bake</h4><ol start=11><li>Bake the bread in the preheated oven for about 30–35 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. If the top browns too quickly, cover it loosely with aluminum foil.</li></ol><h4 id=step-10-cool-and-decorate>Step 10: Cool and Decorate</h4><ol start=12><li>Once baked, remove the bread from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack. If desired, once cooled, you can drizzle icing made from powdered sugar and milk over the top and sprinkle with colored sprinkles. You may also place hard-boiled eggs around the base of the bread for decoration.</li></ol><h2 id=enjoying-your-easter-bread>Enjoying Your Easter Bread</h2><p>Your homemade Easter bread is now ready to be enjoyed!
