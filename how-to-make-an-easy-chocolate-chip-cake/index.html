You likely have most of them in your kitchen already!</p><h3 id=basic-ingredients>Basic Ingredients:</h3><ul><li><strong>2 cups all-purpose flour</strong></li><li><strong>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</strong></li><li><strong>½ teaspoon baking soda</strong></li><li><strong>¼ teaspoon salt</strong></li><li><strong>½ cup unsalted butter (softened)</strong></li><li><strong>1 cup granulated sugar</strong></li><li><strong>2 large eggs</strong></li><li><strong>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</strong></li><li><strong>1 cup sour cream</strong> (for a tender, moist crumb)</li><li><strong>1 ½ cups semi-sweet chocolate chips</strong></li></ul><h3 id=optional-add-ins>Optional Add-ins:</h3><ul><li><strong>Chopped walnuts or pecans</strong> (for a crunchy twist)</li><li><strong>1 tablespoon cocoa powder</strong> (for a richer chocolate flavor)</li></ul><p>Having these ingredients on hand will ensure that you’re all set for this simple yet indulgent chocolate chip cake. Now let’s get baking!</p><h2 id=instructions-for-the-easy-chocolate-chip-cake>Instructions for the Easy Chocolate Chip Cake</h2><h3 id=1-preheat-the-oven-and-prepare-the-pan>1. Preheat the Oven and Prepare the Pan</h3><p>To get started, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). It’s important to ensure the oven is fully heated before the cake goes in to achieve an even rise.</p><p>While the oven heats up, grease and flour a 9-inch round or square cake pan. You can also line the bottom with parchment paper to make sure the cake doesn’t stick. If you prefer, you can use a bundt pan for a more decorative shape.</p><h3 id=2-combine-the-dry-ingredients>2. Combine the Dry Ingredients</h3><p>In a medium bowl, sift together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Sifting helps to break up any clumps and ensures that the dry ingredients are evenly distributed.</p><p>This step is crucial for creating a smooth batter and ensuring that your cake rises evenly.</p><h3 id=3-cream-the-butter-and-sugar>3. Cream the Butter and Sugar</h3><p>In a separate large bowl, use a hand mixer or stand mixer to cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar until light and fluffy. This process incorporates air into the mixture, helping the cake become light and tender.</p><p>Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed to ensure everything is thoroughly mixed. This typically takes about 2-3 minutes at medium speed.</p><h3 id=4-add-the-eggs-and-vanilla>4. Add the Eggs and Vanilla</h3><p>Next, add the eggs, one at a time, to the butter and sugar mixture. Beat well after each addition. After the eggs are fully incorporated, add the vanilla extract. The vanilla adds a rich depth of flavor that complements the sweetness of the chocolate chips.</p><h3 id=5-mix-in-the-sour-cream>5. Mix in the Sour Cream</h3><p>Now it’s time to add the sour cream. The sour cream is what gives this chocolate chip cake its moist, tender crumb. Mix it in until fully combined.</p><h3 id=6-gradually-add-the-dry-ingredients>6. Gradually Add the Dry Ingredients</h3><p>With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the dry ingredients into the wet mixture. Do this in two to three additions, mixing just until incorporated. Be careful not to overmix the batter, as this can make the cake dense.</p><p>If you’re using cocoa powder for a more intense chocolate flavor, now’s the time to add it. Sift the cocoa powder along with the dry ingredients to ensure it blends smoothly into the batter.</p><h3 id=7-fold-in-the-chocolate-chips>7. Fold in the Chocolate Chips</h3><p>Finally, fold in the chocolate chips. Make sure they’re evenly distributed throughout the batter, but again, don’t overmix.</p><p>For extra texture and flavor, you can also add chopped nuts, such as walnuts or pecans. This will give the cake a satisfying crunch and a nice contrast to the soft, melty chocolate chips.</p><h3 id=8-pour-the-batter-into-the-pan>8. Pour the Batter into the Pan</h3><p>Once everything is well mixed, pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Use a spatula to smooth the top and ensure the batter is evenly distributed.</p><h3 id=9-bake-the-cake>9. Bake the Cake</h3><p>Place the cake in the preheated oven and bake for 30-35 minutes. The cake is done when a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs attached.</p><p>Be sure to check the cake at the 30-minute mark, as oven temperatures can vary. If you notice that the top is browning too quickly, you can cover it loosely with aluminum foil to prevent burning while the center finishes baking.</p><h3 id=10-cool-the-cake>10. Cool the Cake</h3><p>Once the cake is baked, remove it from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. After that, remove the cake from the pan and place it on a wire rack to cool completely.</p><h3 id=11-optional-frost-or-glaze>11. Optional: Frost or Glaze</h3><p>If you like your chocolate chip cake with extra sweetness, you can add a frosting or glaze. A simple chocolate ganache made with heavy cream and chocolate is a great option. Alternatively, a dusting of powdered sugar can be a lighter touch.</p><h3 id=12-serve-and-enjoy>12. Serve and Enjoy!</h3><p>Once the cake has fully cooled and any optional frosting or glaze has been added, it’s time to slice and serve! This cake pairs beautifully with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for an extra indulgent treat.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-best-chocolate-chip-cake>Tips for the Best Chocolate Chip Cake</h2><p>While this chocolate chip cake recipe is easy to follow, there are a few tips that can help you achieve the best results:</p><h3 id=1-use-room-temperature-ingredients>1. <strong>Use Room Temperature Ingredients</strong></h3><p>Make sure the butter, eggs, and sour cream are at room temperature before you begin mixing. This helps them blend together more smoothly and ensures the batter is evenly mixed.</p><h3 id=2-dont-overmix-the-batter>2. <strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter</strong></h3><p>Mixing the batter too much can lead to a dense cake. Once the dry ingredients are added, mix only until they are just incorporated. This will give you a lighter, fluffier texture.</p><h3 id=3-choose-the-right-chocolate-chips>3. <strong>Choose the Right Chocolate Chips</strong></h3><p>Semi-sweet chocolate chips are the best choice for this recipe, but you can experiment with milk chocolate or dark chocolate if you prefer. You can even use a mix of chocolate chips for added variety.</p><h3 id=4-add-a-dash-of-cinnamon>4. <strong>Add a Dash of Cinnamon</strong></h3><p>For an extra flavor boost, try adding a teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the dry ingredients. Cinnamon complements chocolate beautifully and gives the cake a warm, cozy aroma.</p><h3 id=5-use-a-toothpick-to-check-for-doneness>5. <strong>Use a Toothpick to Check for Doneness</strong></h3><p>To ensure the cake is fully baked, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs attached, your cake is ready. If the toothpick comes out with wet batter, return the cake to the oven and check again in a few minutes.</p><h3 id=6-store-the-cake-properly>6. <strong>Store the Cake Properly</strong></h3><p>If you have leftovers (which is unlikely!), store the cake in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. You can also freeze the cake for longer storage—just wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and freeze for up to 3 months.</p><h2 id=variations-to-try>Variations to Try</h2><p>While this chocolate chip cake is delicious as-is, you can easily customize it to suit your tastes. Here are a few fun variations to try:</p><h3 id=1-chocolate-chip-bundt-cake>1. <strong>Chocolate Chip Bundt Cake</strong></h3><p>If you want to make a more impressive presentation, try baking this cake in a bundt pan. The chocolate chips will look beautiful cascading over the cake’s curves, and the dense, moist texture makes it perfect for this type of pan.</p><h3 id=2-chocolate-chip-banana-cake>2. <strong>Chocolate Chip Banana Cake</strong></h3><p>For a twist, add mashed ripe bananas to the batter for a banana-chocolate chip fusion. This will give the cake a natural sweetness and a slight banana flavor.</p><h3 id=3-chocolate-chip-coffee-cake>3. <strong>Chocolate Chip Coffee Cake</strong></h3><p>Add a layer of cinnamon-sugar streusel in between the batter layers to make a chocolate chip coffee cake. The cinnamon and sugar create a crunchy, sweet contrast to the soft, moist cake.</p><h3 id=4-double-chocolate-chip-cake>4. <strong>Double Chocolate Chip Cake</strong></h3><p>For chocolate lovers, add some cocoa powder to the batter to make it a double chocolate chip cake. You can also use mini chocolate chips for a more even distribution of chocolate throughout the cake.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Making a chocolate chip cake from scratch is an incredibly rewarding and simple process that yields a delicious, moist cake with the perfect balance of sweetness and richness. Whether you enjoy it as a snack with coffee, a dessert for a celebration, or an afternoon treat, this cake is sure to become a family favorite.</p><p>With just a few basic ingredients and some helpful tips, you can create a homemade chocolate chip cake that’s bursting with flavor and texture.
