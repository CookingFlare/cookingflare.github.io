Whether you have a dairy allergy, follow a dairy-free lifestyle, or simply want to try something new, this recipe will give you the crunch and flavor you&rsquo;re looking for without any dairy-based ingredients.</p><p>In this blog post, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know to make the best dairy-free breaded chicken. From the breading technique to the seasoning, we’ll cover all the details to ensure your dish is delicious, crispy, and full of flavor. So, let’s dive in!</p><h2 id=ingredients-youll-need>Ingredients You&rsquo;ll Need</h2><p>Making a perfectly breaded chicken doesn’t require complicated ingredients. With a few pantry staples, you can whip up a satisfying and tasty meal. Here’s what you’ll need for this dairy-free breaded chicken:</p><ul><li><strong>Chicken breast or chicken thighs</strong> – Boneless and skinless pieces of chicken work best for this recipe. You can choose whichever cut you prefer, but chicken breasts are a popular choice due to their tenderness.</li><li><strong>All-purpose flour</strong> – This will serve as the first layer in the breading process, helping the next layers stick.</li><li><strong>Cornstarch</strong> – Cornstarch helps make the breading extra crispy. It’s key to that perfect crunch!</li><li><strong>Breadcrumbs</strong> – Opt for plain breadcrumbs to keep the breading simple. If you’re aiming for a more elevated flavor, try seasoned breadcrumbs or even panko breadcrumbs for a lighter, crispier texture.</li><li><strong>Salt</strong> – Essential for enhancing the flavor of the chicken.</li><li><strong>Pepper</strong> – Freshly ground black pepper for a mild kick.</li><li><strong>Garlic powder</strong> – A bit of garlic powder adds savory depth to the breading without overpowering the other flavors.</li><li><strong>Onion powder</strong> – Onion powder complements the garlic powder, making the breading more aromatic and flavorful.</li><li><strong>Paprika</strong> – Adds a smoky flavor and vibrant color to the chicken.</li><li><strong>Dairy-free milk</strong> – Choose a plant-based milk like almond milk, oat milk, or soy milk to create the wet coating that helps the breadcrumbs stick.</li><li><strong>Olive oil</strong> – For frying the chicken and getting it crispy.</li><li><strong>Lemon juice (optional)</strong> – A squeeze of fresh lemon juice at the end adds a bit of tang and balances out the richness of the breading.</li></ul><h2 id=step-by-step-guide-to-making-dairy-free-breaded-chicken>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Dairy-Free Breaded Chicken</h2><h3 id=1-prepare-the-chicken>1. Prepare the Chicken</h3><p>Start by preparing your chicken. If you’re using chicken breasts, you may want to slice them in half horizontally to ensure they cook evenly and get nice and crispy. Make sure the chicken pieces are all of a similar thickness for uniform cooking. Once the chicken is prepared, pat it dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture, which helps the breading stick better.</p><h3 id=2-season-the-chicken>2. Season the Chicken</h3><p>Next, season your chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika. These seasonings will give the chicken a flavorful base. Make sure to coat the chicken evenly on both sides with the seasoning, rubbing it in gently so it adheres well.</p><h3 id=3-set-up-the-breading-station>3. Set Up the Breading Station</h3><p>Set up a breading station with three separate bowls:</p><ul><li><strong>First bowl</strong>: Place the all-purpose flour and cornstarch together. Stir them together to combine.</li><li><strong>Second bowl</strong>: Pour your dairy-free milk into this bowl. If you like, you can add a teaspoon of lemon juice here to help tenderize the chicken and enhance the flavor.</li><li><strong>Third bowl</strong>: Add the breadcrumbs to this bowl. You can season these breadcrumbs with extra spices or herbs if you’d like, but the garlic and onion powder already add a nice flavor.</li></ul><h3 id=4-coat-the-chicken>4. Coat the Chicken</h3><p>Now it&rsquo;s time for the fun part! Start by dipping each piece of chicken into the flour mixture, coating it evenly on both sides. Shake off any excess flour. Next, dip the chicken into the dairy-free milk, ensuring it’s fully covered in the liquid. Finally, press the chicken into the breadcrumb mixture, making sure to coat it completely on both sides. The more breadcrumbs that stick, the crunchier the chicken will be. For an extra crispy texture, you can repeat the flour, milk, and breadcrumb steps for a double coating.</p><h3 id=5-heat-the-oil>5. Heat the Oil</h3><p>In a large skillet, heat about 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat. You’ll need enough oil to coat the bottom of the pan but not drown the chicken. Heat the oil until it shimmers, but be careful not to let it get too hot, as this can burn the breading before the chicken is cooked through.</p><h3 id=6-cook-the-chicken>6. Cook the Chicken</h3><p>Carefully place the breaded chicken into the hot oil. Cook the chicken for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until the breading is golden brown and crispy. You can test the chicken’s doneness by cutting into the thickest part of the chicken to make sure it&rsquo;s no longer pink inside. If you’re using a thermometer, the internal temperature should reach 165°F (74°C).</p><h3 id=7-drain-and-rest>7. Drain and Rest</h3><p>Once your chicken is cooked and crispy, remove it from the skillet and place it on a plate lined with paper towels to drain off any excess oil. Let the chicken rest for a couple of minutes before serving, as this helps retain the juices and ensures each bite is tender.</p><h3 id=8-serve-and-enjoy>8. Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Now that your dairy-free breaded chicken is ready, serve it with your favorite sides. You can pair it with mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, a side salad, or even a dipping sauce like honey mustard, BBQ sauce, or a tangy vegan ranch dressing. A squeeze of fresh lemon juice right before serving can also add a nice touch of brightness to the dish.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-dairy-free-breaded-chicken>Tips for Perfect Dairy-Free Breaded Chicken</h2><ol><li><strong>Use panko breadcrumbs</strong>: If you want the crispiest possible chicken, opt for panko breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs. Panko is lighter and flakier, creating a crunchier texture.</li><li><strong>Double coat the chicken</strong>: For an extra crispy crust, double coat the chicken by dipping it first in the flour mixture, then the dairy-free milk, then the breadcrumbs, and repeat the process. This will give the chicken a thicker, crunchier crust.</li><li><strong>Don’t overcrowd the pan</strong>: If you’re cooking multiple pieces of chicken at once, make sure not to overcrowd the pan. If there’s too much chicken in the pan, the temperature of the oil will drop, and the breading won’t crisp up properly.</li><li><strong>Add spices to the breading</strong>: Customize your breading by adding different spices to the breadcrumbs. A little cayenne pepper, dried oregano, or dried thyme can take the flavor to the next level.</li><li><strong>Bake instead of fry</strong>: If you prefer a healthier version of this dish, you can bake the breaded chicken in a preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for about 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through. This will give you a crispy crust with less oil.</li></ol><h2 id=why-this-recipe-is-great-for-dairy-free-diets>Why This Recipe is Great for Dairy-Free Diets</h2><p>Dairy-free diets are increasingly popular, whether due to lactose intolerance, allergies, or personal preferences.
