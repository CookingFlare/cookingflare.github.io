This pizza, originating from Naples, is known for its simple yet flavorful ingredients, crisp crust, and tantalizingly soft center. If you’ve always wanted to recreate this authentic dish in your own kitchen, here’s a step-by-step guide to making a Neapolitan pizza from scratch.</p><h2 id=understanding-neapolitan-pizza>Understanding Neapolitan Pizza</h2><p>Before we get started, it’s important to understand what makes Neapolitan pizza so unique. Neapolitan pizza is made with a few core ingredients: a thin, soft crust, fresh mozzarella, San Marzano tomatoes, extra virgin olive oil, and fresh basil. The pizza is baked at a very high temperature, typically in a wood-fired oven, which gives it its characteristic crispy crust and tender center.</p><p>In Naples, the art of pizza-making has been passed down through generations, and the ingredients are highly regulated to preserve the traditional flavors. The crust, called &ldquo;cornicione,&rdquo; is a key feature of the pizza. It should rise to form a soft, puffy border while keeping the center thin and flexible enough to fold.</p><h3 id=the-dough>The Dough</h3><p>The foundation of any good Neapolitan pizza is its dough. The dough is simple but requires patience to get right. It&rsquo;s made from flour, water, salt, and yeast, and needs time to ferment and develop its flavor.</p><h4 id=ingredients-for-neapolitan-pizza-dough>Ingredients for Neapolitan Pizza Dough:</h4><ul><li>500g (about 4 cups) of &lsquo;00&rsquo; flour (highly refined Italian flour)</li><li>325ml (1 1/3 cups) of lukewarm water</li><li>10g (2 teaspoons) of sea salt</li><li>1g (1/4 teaspoon) of active dry yeast</li><li>1 tablespoon of olive oil (optional, for added richness)</li></ul><h4 id=instructions-for-making-the-dough>Instructions for Making the Dough:</h4><ol><li><strong>Activate the Yeast</strong>: Start by dissolving the yeast in lukewarm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it starts to bubble. This ensures that the yeast is active and ready to work.</li><li><strong>Combine Ingredients</strong>: In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Create a well in the center and pour in the activated yeast mixture. Mix the ingredients together until a dough begins to form.</li><li><strong>Knead the Dough</strong>: Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and knead it for about 10 minutes. The goal is to develop the gluten, which gives the dough its structure and elasticity. The dough should be smooth and slightly tacky to the touch.</li><li><strong>First Proofing</strong>: Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and cover it with a damp cloth. Let it rest for at least 1 hour, or until it doubles in size. You can also let it rise for longer (up to 8 hours) for a more developed flavor.</li><li><strong>Shape the Dough</strong>: Once the dough has risen, divide it into 2 or 3 equal portions. Roll each portion into a ball, cover with a damp cloth, and let them rest for another 30 minutes. This will make the dough easier to stretch.</li></ol><h3 id=the-tomato-sauce>The Tomato Sauce</h3><p>A true Neapolitan pizza uses San Marzano tomatoes, which are grown in the volcanic soil of the San Marzano region near Naples. These tomatoes are known for their sweet and low-acid flavor, making them the ideal base for pizza sauce.</p><h4 id=ingredients-for-the-sauce>Ingredients for the Sauce:</h4><ul><li>400g (1 can) of San Marzano tomatoes (whole or crushed)</li><li>1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil</li><li>1/2 teaspoon of sea salt</li><li>Fresh basil leaves (optional, for extra flavor)</li></ul><h4 id=instructions-for-making-the-sauce>Instructions for Making the Sauce:</h4><ol><li><strong>Prepare the Tomatoes</strong>: If you’re using whole San Marzano tomatoes, crush them by hand or with a fork in a bowl. The goal is to keep the texture chunky but spreadable.</li><li><strong>Season the Sauce</strong>: In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the crushed tomatoes and salt. Let the sauce simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. You want the sauce to thicken slightly but still retain some freshness.</li><li><strong>Add Basil</strong>: Optionally, tear a few fresh basil leaves into the sauce for an added layer of flavor. Stir them in at the end of cooking and allow them to infuse the sauce for a few minutes.</li></ol><h3 id=the-cheese>The Cheese</h3><p>The best cheese for Neapolitan pizza is fresh mozzarella, specifically mozzarella di bufala (buffalo mozzarella). It has a rich, creamy texture and a tangy flavor that melts beautifully on the pizza. If you can’t find buffalo mozzarella, fresh cow’s milk mozzarella can be used as a substitute.</p><h4 id=instructions-for-preparing-the-cheese>Instructions for Preparing the Cheese:</h4><ol><li><strong>Drain the Mozzarella</strong>: If you’re using fresh mozzarella, be sure to drain off any excess liquid. This prevents the pizza from becoming soggy during baking.</li><li><strong>Tear the Mozzarella</strong>: Tear the mozzarella into small pieces or slices. Avoid cutting it with a knife, as tearing allows it to maintain its texture and melt more evenly.</li></ol><h3 id=assembling-the-pizza>Assembling the Pizza</h3><p>Now comes the fun part—assembling your pizza! With your dough, sauce, and cheese ready, you can begin crafting your Neapolitan pizza.</p><h4 id=instructions-for-assembling-the-pizza>Instructions for Assembling the Pizza:</h4><ol><li><strong>Preheat the Oven</strong>: Traditional Neapolitan pizzas are baked in a wood-fired oven at temperatures around 800°F (427°C). At home, you can achieve a similar result by preheating your oven to the highest setting (usually 500°F/260°C). Place a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven to heat up.</li><li><strong>Stretch the Dough</strong>: On a floured surface, take one dough ball and begin stretching it into a thin, round shape. You can use your hands or a rolling pin to achieve the desired size. The dough should be thin in the center with a slightly thicker crust around the edge.</li><li><strong>Add the Sauce</strong>: Spread a thin layer of your homemade tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a border around the edges for the crust. Be careful not to add too much sauce, as Neapolitan pizza is known for having a light sauce-to-dough ratio.</li><li><strong>Add the Cheese</strong>: Scatter the pieces of mozzarella evenly over the sauce. You don’t want to overload the pizza with cheese—Neapolitan pizza is known for its balance of ingredients.</li><li><strong>Drizzle with Olive Oil</strong>: Drizzle a small amount of extra virgin olive oil over the top of the pizza. This will help the pizza bake to perfection and give it a delicious sheen.</li></ol><h3 id=baking-the-pizza>Baking the Pizza</h3><p>The key to baking a Neapolitan pizza is achieving the right balance of heat and time. The pizza needs to bake quickly at a high temperature to get that crisp, slightly charred crust while keeping the cheese melted and bubbly.</p><h4 id=instructions-for-baking>Instructions for Baking:</h4><ol><li><strong>Transfer to the Oven</strong>: Carefully transfer your assembled pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven. If you&rsquo;re using a pizza peel, this is where it comes in handy for a smooth transfer.</li><li><strong>Bake the Pizza</strong>: Bake the pizza for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the crust is golden and slightly charred, and the cheese is bubbling. Keep an eye on it, as the high heat can cook the pizza quickly.</li><li><strong>Check the Bottom</strong>: The crust should have a nice crispy texture on the bottom. If you’re using a pizza stone, the heat from the stone will help achieve this. If you&rsquo;re not using a stone, you may need to rotate the pizza halfway through the baking process for even cooking.</li></ol><h3 id=serving-the-pizza>Serving the Pizza</h3><p>Once your pizza is baked to perfection, it&rsquo;s time to serve! Remove the pizza from the oven and let it rest for a minute or two before slicing. The Neapolitan pizza is typically cut into wedges and served immediately. To add the finishing touch, you can garnish with a few fresh basil leaves for an extra burst of flavor.</p><h3 id=tips-for-perfect-neapolitan-pizza>Tips for Perfect Neapolitan Pizza</h3><ul><li><strong>Use Quality Ingredients</strong>: The simplicity of Neapolitan pizza means that the quality of the ingredients is crucial. Use fresh mozzarella, San Marzano tomatoes, and high-quality extra virgin olive oil for the best results.</li><li><strong>Stretch the Dough by Hand</strong>: Instead of using a rolling pin, stretch the dough by hand to keep the air bubbles intact, which helps create a light, airy crust.</li><li><strong>Work Quickly</strong>: Neapolitan pizzas are meant to cook fast. The longer they stay in the oven, the less authentic they’ll be. Make sure your oven is preheated fully to maintain a high temperature.</li><li><strong>Don’t Overload the Pizza</strong>: Neapolitan pizza is known for its simplicity. Resist the urge to add too many toppings. A few key ingredients are all it takes to create a delicious pizza.</li><li><strong>Invest in a Pizza Stone</strong>: A pizza stone helps to evenly distribute heat, giving the crust that perfect crispiness. If you bake your pizza directly on a baking sheet, the bottom might not get as crispy.</li></ul><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>Making a traditional Neapolitan pizza at home is a fantastic way to experience a piece of Italian culinary history. With the right ingredients, technique, and a bit of practice, you can create an authentic pizza that rivals what you&rsquo;d find in Naples. Whether you&rsquo;re making it for a family dinner, a special occasion, or just because you&rsquo;re craving a delicious homemade pizza, this recipe is sure to impress. So gather your ingredients, preheat your oven, and enjoy the process of crafting a Neapolitan masterpiece right in your own kitchen!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/categories/pizza-and-flatbreads/>Pizza and Flatbreads</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/how-to-make-a-thin-crust-margherita-pizza/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>How to Make a Thin-Crust Margherita Pizza</span>
