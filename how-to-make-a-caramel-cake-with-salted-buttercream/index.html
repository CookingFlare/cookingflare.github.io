Its rich, deep flavor and the luscious salted buttercream complementing its sweetness make it a favorite for every occasion. Whether you&rsquo;re hosting a special event, celebrating a birthday, or simply craving a delicious homemade treat, this caramel cake with salted buttercream is sure to impress your guests and satisfy your sweet tooth.</p><p>In this blog post, we’ll walk you through every step of making the perfect caramel cake with salted buttercream, from preparing the cake itself to crafting the smooth, silky frosting. So, let’s dive in and learn how to bake and assemble this delectable dessert that will undoubtedly become a household favorite.</p><h3 id=ingredients-for-the-caramel-cake>Ingredients for the Caramel Cake</h3><p>Before we begin baking, let’s go over the ingredients you’ll need to make the cake base. This rich and flavorful cake is the heart of the recipe, and the caramel adds the perfect amount of sweetness and depth to each bite.</p><p><strong>For the Caramel Cake:</strong></p><ul><li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li><li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li><li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li><li>¼ teaspoon salt</li><li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li><li>1 cup brown sugar (preferably light brown sugar)</li><li>2 large eggs</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><li>1 cup buttermilk</li><li>¼ cup caramel sauce (homemade or store-bought)</li><li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li></ul><p>The caramel sauce used in the cake batter plays a significant role in infusing it with that rich caramel flavor. If you prefer a homemade version, it’s not hard to whip up a simple caramel sauce, but store-bought caramel will work just as well for this recipe.</p><h3 id=ingredients-for-the-salted-buttercream>Ingredients for the Salted Buttercream</h3><p>The salted buttercream frosting is the crowning glory of this caramel cake. The buttery richness pairs perfectly with the cake’s sweetness, and the touch of salt cuts through the richness, making every bite feel balanced and decadent.</p><p><strong>For the Salted Buttercream:</strong></p><ul><li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li><li>4 cups powdered sugar</li><li>2 tablespoons heavy cream</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><li>1 teaspoon sea salt (adjust based on your preference)</li><li>2 tablespoons caramel sauce (for drizzling)</li></ul><p>The salted buttercream is what makes this cake truly indulgent. You can adjust the salt level in the frosting depending on how much of a salty-sweet contrast you want. This frosting is thick, smooth, and easy to spread, ensuring it perfectly coats the cake layers for a luxurious finish.</p><h3 id=how-to-make-the-caramel-cake>How to Make the Caramel Cake</h3><p>Let’s get started with making the caramel cake itself. Once baked, the caramel flavor will be even more pronounced when combined with the frosting, creating an irresistible dessert.</p><h4 id=step-1-preheat-the-oven>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h4><p>First, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 8-inch round cake pans to prevent the cake from sticking after baking. You can also line the bottom of the pans with parchment paper for extra security.</p><h4 id=step-2-mix-the-dry-ingredients>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h4><p>In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Sifting ensures that there are no lumps in the dry ingredients and helps the cake rise evenly.</p><h4 id=step-3-cream-the-butter-and-sugar>Step 3: Cream the Butter and Sugar</h4><p>In a separate large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and brown sugar. Using an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. This will take about 3-5 minutes, and it’s an important step to ensure the cake has a soft, airy texture.</p><h4 id=step-4-add-the-eggs-and-vanilla>Step 4: Add the Eggs and Vanilla</h4><p>Once the butter and sugar are creamed, add in the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, stir in the vanilla extract. The mixture may appear slightly curdled at this stage, but don’t worry; it will come together when you add the dry ingredients and buttermilk.</p><h4 id=step-5-combine-the-wet-and-dry-ingredients>Step 5: Combine the Wet and Dry Ingredients</h4><p>Now, it’s time to combine the dry ingredients with the wet mixture. Add the dry ingredients to the butter-sugar mixture in three parts, alternating with the buttermilk. Start by adding a third of the flour mixture, followed by half of the buttermilk. Repeat until everything is incorporated. Finally, fold in the caramel sauce and vegetable oil, which will help add moisture and depth of flavor to the cake.</p><h4 id=step-6-bake-the-cake>Step 6: Bake the Cake</h4><p>Divide the batter evenly between the two prepared cake pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula to ensure they bake evenly. Bake the cakes in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</p><p>Once baked, remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. It&rsquo;s essential that the cakes cool fully before frosting to avoid the buttercream melting.</p><h3 id=how-to-make-the-salted-buttercream>How to Make the Salted Buttercream</h3><p>While the cake is cooling, let’s move on to the salted buttercream. The key to a great buttercream is proper mixing, so take your time and ensure the ingredients come together smoothly.</p><h4 id=step-1-beat-the-butter>Step 1: Beat the Butter</h4><p>In a large bowl, beat the softened butter with an electric mixer on medium speed for about 3 minutes. The butter should become soft and creamy, creating a smooth base for the frosting.</p><h4 id=step-2-add-powdered-sugar-and-heavy-cream>Step 2: Add Powdered Sugar and Heavy Cream</h4><p>Gradually add the powdered sugar to the butter, about one cup at a time. Beat well after each addition until the mixture becomes fluffy. Add the heavy cream to the mixture, one tablespoon at a time, until the desired consistency is reached. You may need more or less cream depending on the thickness you prefer for your buttercream.</p><h4 id=step-3-mix-in-vanilla-and-salt>Step 3: Mix in Vanilla and Salt</h4><p>Add the vanilla extract and sea salt, adjusting the amount of salt depending on how salty you want the frosting to be. Continue to beat the mixture on medium-high speed for 3-5 minutes until it becomes light and airy.</p><h4 id=step-4-add-caramel-sauce>Step 4: Add Caramel Sauce</h4><p>Finally, add the caramel sauce to the buttercream. This will not only enhance the caramel flavor of the cake but also give the frosting a beautiful sheen. Mix until the caramel is fully incorporated into the buttercream.</p><h3 id=assembling-the-cake>Assembling the Cake</h3><p>Now that both your cake layers and buttercream are ready, it’s time to assemble the cake. The process is straightforward, but be sure to work gently to avoid crumbling the delicate layers.</p><h4 id=step-1-level-the-cake-layers>Step 1: Level the Cake Layers</h4><p>Using a serrated knife, carefully level the top of each cake layer. This ensures that the layers are flat and stable when stacked on top of each other.</p><h4 id=step-2-frost-the-cake>Step 2: Frost the Cake</h4><p>Place one cake layer on a serving plate or cake stand. Spread a generous amount of salted buttercream over the top of the first layer. Use an offset spatula to smooth it evenly, making sure to cover the entire surface.</p><p>Place the second cake layer on top of the frosted layer and gently press down to help them stick together. Coat the entire cake with the remaining buttercream, making sure to cover the sides and top evenly. If you prefer a rustic look, you can use a spatula to create texture on the frosting.</p><h4 id=step-3-drizzle-with-caramel>Step 3: Drizzle with Caramel</h4><p>For the finishing touch, drizzle extra caramel sauce over the top of the cake. Allow the caramel to slightly drip down the sides for a beautiful presentation. The combination of the salted buttercream and rich caramel drizzle will make the cake look as good as it tastes.</p><h4 id=step-4-let-the-cake-set>Step 4: Let the Cake Set</h4><p>Allow the cake to set for about 30 minutes to an hour at room temperature. This will give the frosting time to firm up, and the flavors will meld together, making each slice even more delicious.</p><h3 id=tips-for-making-the-perfect-caramel-cake-with-salted-buttercream>Tips for Making the Perfect Caramel Cake with Salted Buttercream</h3><ul><li><strong>Use room temperature ingredients:</strong> Make sure your butter, eggs, and buttermilk are at room temperature. This ensures they mix together evenly, resulting in a smoother batter and better texture.</li><li><strong>Don’t overmix the batter:</strong> Overmixing can lead to a dense cake. Mix just until the ingredients are combined to ensure a light, fluffy cake.</li><li><strong>Caramel sauce matters:</strong> Whether you use store-bought or homemade caramel sauce, ensure it’s smooth and thick. A runny caramel will make the cake soggy.</li><li><strong>Adjust salt levels:</strong> The amount of sea salt in the buttercream is a matter of personal preference. Start with a teaspoon and taste as you go to ensure you achieve the perfect balance between sweet and salty.</li><li><strong>Chill the frosting:</strong> If the buttercream gets too soft while you’re frosting the cake, pop it into the fridge for 10-15 minutes to firm it up before continuing.</li></ul><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>Making a caramel cake with salted buttercream is a rewarding experience that yields a cake bursting with rich flavor and texture. The smooth caramel cake pairs wonderfully with the decadent salted buttercream, creating a perfect balance of sweet and salty. Whether you’re an experienced baker or just starting out, this recipe is a great way to impress your friends and family.</p><p>So, gather your ingredients and get baking! Once you try this cake, you’ll find it hard to resist the combination of flavors and the comforting feeling of a homemade dessert. Enjoy!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/categories/cakes-and-cupcakes/>Cakes and Cupcakes</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/how-to-make-a-cake-for-a-themed-party/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>How to Make a Cake for a Themed Party</span>
