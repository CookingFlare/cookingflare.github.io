Here are some tips to get you started:</p><p>Make it fun: Engage your kids in the cooking process. Let them help with meal planning, grocery shopping, and cooking preparation. This can help them develop an interest in the food they're eating.
Start small: Begin with small portions or taste tests. This can help your kids get used to new flavors without overwhelming them.
Involve the senses: Talk to your kids about the sights, smells, and textures of different elements. For example, the aroma of cardamom or the crunch of fresh cilantro can spark their curiosity.

For example, you can compare the gooey cheese of naan to melted mozzarella on a pizza.</p><p>These kid-friendly Indian recipes are a great starting point for introducing your family to the rich flavors and aromas of Indian cuisine. So go ahead, give them a try, and make mealtime a fun experience for your kids! By cooking together and making it a positive experience for your kids, you can start to overcome any eating difficulties or trauma that you or your child might be carrying around.
