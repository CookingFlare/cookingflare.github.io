The word "Mezze" translates to "small dishes" or "appetizers," and that's exactly what this platter represents – a delightful assortment of small, shareable plates that showcase the flavors and aromas of the region.
Planning Your Mezze Platter
Before you begin preparing your Mezze platter, consider the variety of flavors and textures you want to include. Traditional dishes from Middle Eastern cuisine are known for their use of fresh vegetables, herbs, and spices, as well as dips and spreads, small skewers of meat and vegetables, and quick bites of pastry and bread. This diversity allows you to cater to a wide range of dietary needs and preferences.
Dips and Spreads
A Mezze platter wouldn't be complete without a selection of dips and spreads. Some classic options include:</p><p>Hummus: Made from chickpeas, tahini, garlic, and lemon juice, hummus is a staple in many Middle Eastern countries.
Baba Ghanoush: A roasted eggplant dip with a creamy texture and smoky flavor, often served with pita bread or crackers.
Tabbouleh: Not a traditional dip, but a salad of bulgur, parsley, tomatoes, mint, onions, and mint, dressed with lemon juice and olive oil, served as a relish-like condiment.</p><p>Breads and Pastries
There are few foods as versatile as bread when creating a Mezze platter. Here are some of your options:</p><p>Flatbreads: Toasted or grilled flatbreads served with various toppings such as olive tapenade, feta cheese, za'atar, and olives.
Pita Chips: Perfect for scooping up dips and spreads, served simply with a bowl of aromatic spices for guests to season and dip.</p><p>Meat and Vegetable Skewers
Skewers are a convenient and visually appealing way to serve a variety of dishes. Here are a few pork-free options to consider:</p><p>Shish Taouk: Marinated chicken breast pieces that have been skewered and grilled to perfection.
Dolmas: Yes, these are technically a stuffed grape leaf dish, but when sliced, they become a contrasting texture and flavor to your other options.</p><p>Little Pieces of Food
Miniature dishes are also a defining characteristic of a traditional Mezze platter. These bite-sized options allow you to incorporate a range of flavors without overwhelming your guests. Consider making:</p><p>Falafel: These vegetarian chickpea patties, which are slightly withered and intimidate, when eaten, show kids of all ages to take in interesting food early.
Stuffed Tomatoes: Large tomatoes filled with a flavorful combination of rice, meat, and spices, making them a great mid-mezza pallet-clenser.
