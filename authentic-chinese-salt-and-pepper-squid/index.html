This delicious appetizer or main dish is a favorite in Chinese restaurants, often appearing as part of a larger banquet or enjoyed alone as a snack. It’s crispy, flavorful, and packed with savory umami, with the added kick of chili heat and aromatic herbs.</p><p>In this post, we will take you through an authentic Chinese Salt and Pepper Squid recipe. This recipe uses fresh squid, seasoned with a mix of salt, pepper, and a variety of other aromatic ingredients that bring out the natural sweetness of the squid. The result is an irresistible, crispy coating and tender inside. Perfect for anyone looking to recreate the mouthwatering taste of Chinese-style squid at home.</p><h2 id=ingredients>Ingredients</h2><h3 id=for-the-squid>For the Squid:</h3><ul><li>4 medium-sized squid (about 500g), cleaned and sliced into rings or bite-sized pieces</li><li>2 tablespoons rice flour (for extra crispiness)</li><li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li><li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li><li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li><li>Vegetable oil (for deep frying)</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-seasoning>For the Seasoning:</h3><ul><li>1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder</li><li>1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns (crushed)</li><li>2-3 fresh red chilies (sliced)</li><li>2 cloves garlic (minced)</li><li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger (minced)</li><li>1/4 cup green onions (chopped, for garnish)</li><li>A pinch of salt (to taste)</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-dipping-sauce-optional-but-recommended>For the Dipping Sauce (optional but recommended):</h3><ul><li>2 tablespoons light soy sauce</li><li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li><li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li><li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li><li>A pinch of chili flakes</li></ul><h2 id=preparing-the-squid>Preparing the Squid</h2><p>To start, the key to making perfect salt and pepper squid is to ensure the squid is properly cleaned and sliced. Fresh squid will give you the best results, but if you’re using frozen squid, make sure it’s thoroughly thawed and excess moisture is removed.</p><h3 id=step-1-clean-the-squid>Step 1: Clean the Squid</h3><ul><li>Begin by removing the squid&rsquo;s head, tentacles, and ink sac. If you’re unfamiliar with cleaning squid, it’s best to ask your fishmonger to clean it for you. If you&rsquo;re doing it yourself, cut the squid into rings or small bite-sized pieces. The body part of the squid should be sliced into 1/2-inch rings, while the tentacles can be left as they are.</li></ul><h3 id=step-2-dry-the-squid>Step 2: Dry the Squid</h3><p>After cleaning the squid, pat it dry using paper towels. The key to achieving a crispy texture is to ensure the squid is as dry as possible before coating it in flour. Moisture can create a soggy batter, so it’s essential to take your time with this step.</p><h3 id=step-3-coat-the-squid>Step 3: Coat the Squid</h3><p>In a mixing bowl, combine the rice flour, cornstarch, salt, and freshly ground black pepper. This simple mixture will help create a light and crispy crust on the squid. Toss the squid pieces into the flour mixture until evenly coated. Be sure to shake off any excess flour. The squid should be lightly dusted, not heavily coated.</p><h2 id=frying-the-squid>Frying the Squid</h2><p>The next step is frying the squid to golden perfection. You can use a deep fryer or a heavy-bottomed pan for this step. The oil needs to be hot enough to crisp the squid immediately once it’s submerged.</p><h3 id=step-4-heat-the-oil>Step 4: Heat the Oil</h3><p>Pour enough vegetable oil into a wok or frying pan to submerge the squid. Heat the oil to around 180°C (350°F), which is the ideal temperature for frying. You can test the oil by dropping in a small piece of the flour mixture. If it sizzles immediately and rises to the surface, the oil is ready.</p><h3 id=step-5-fry-the-squid>Step 5: Fry the Squid</h3><p>Carefully drop the coated squid into the hot oil, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Fry the squid in batches if necessary. Fry for 1-2 minutes until the squid turns a crispy golden brown. The squid cooks very quickly, so be sure not to overcook it to maintain its tender texture. Once fried, remove the squid from the oil and drain on paper towels.</p><h2 id=preparing-the-seasoning>Preparing the Seasoning</h2><p>While the squid is frying, it’s time to prepare the seasoning that will give the dish its signature flavor profile.</p><h3 id=step-6-toast-the-sichuan-peppercorns>Step 6: Toast the Sichuan Peppercorns</h3><p>In a dry pan over medium heat, toast the Sichuan peppercorns for 2-3 minutes until they release a fragrant aroma. Be careful not to burn them. Once toasted, crush them lightly using a mortar and pestle or the back of a spoon. This will release the peppercorns&rsquo; signature numbing sensation and floral notes, which are key to the authentic flavor of this dish.</p><h3 id=step-7-stir-fry-the-aromatics>Step 7: Stir-Fry the Aromatics</h3><p>Heat a small amount of vegetable oil in a wok or large frying pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic, ginger, and sliced chilies to the pan. Stir-fry for 30 seconds until fragrant. The heat should be moderate, as you don’t want to burn the garlic or ginger.</p><h3 id=step-8-combine-the-seasoning>Step 8: Combine the Seasoning</h3><p>Once the garlic and ginger are fragrant, add the crushed Sichuan peppercorns and Chinese five-spice powder. Stir well to combine. The five-spice powder adds a warm, aromatic touch that complements the spicy and numbing qualities of the Sichuan peppercorns. After a minute, your seasoning base will be ready.</p><h3 id=step-9-combine-the-squid-and-seasoning>Step 9: Combine the Squid and Seasoning</h3><p>Add the fried squid to the pan with the seasoning and stir gently to coat each piece in the aromatic mixture. Make sure the squid is evenly coated with the fragrant spices, and the heat from the pan will help absorb the flavors into the crispy coating.</p><h3 id=step-10-garnish>Step 10: Garnish</h3><p>Finally, add the chopped green onions to the pan, and give everything a final toss. This adds a fresh, crisp contrast to the dish and enhances the visual appeal with its vibrant green color.</p><h2 id=preparing-the-dipping-sauce>Preparing the Dipping Sauce</h2><p>While the squid can be served on its own with its perfect seasoning, you can also prepare a simple dipping sauce to complement the dish. The combination of salty soy sauce, tangy rice vinegar, and the depth of sesame oil creates a perfect balance of flavors.</p><h3 id=step-11-mix-the-dipping-sauce>Step 11: Mix the Dipping Sauce</h3><p>In a small bowl, mix together light soy sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. For an extra kick, you can sprinkle in a pinch of chili flakes or a dash of chili oil.</p><h2 id=serving-the-salt-and-pepper-squid>Serving the Salt and Pepper Squid</h2><p>Once everything is ready, transfer the crispy, flavorful squid to a serving platter. If desired, you can garnish with extra green onions or even some cilantro leaves for freshness. Serve immediately while hot and crispy, with the dipping sauce on the side.</p><h3 id=tips-for-perfect-salt-and-pepper-squid>Tips for Perfect Salt and Pepper Squid</h3><ul><li><strong>Freshness is Key</strong>: Use fresh squid whenever possible. Frozen squid can work as a substitute, but it may lose some of its delicate texture. Ensure that it is completely thawed and patted dry before use.</li><li><strong>Crispy Coating</strong>: The combination of rice flour and cornstarch ensures a light and crispy coating. Don’t skip this step, as it plays a critical role in the final texture of the dish.</li><li><strong>Temperature of Oil</strong>: Make sure the oil is hot enough to fry the squid quickly. Too cold oil will result in a greasy, soggy coating, while too hot oil can burn the squid before it cooks through.</li><li><strong>Customizing Spice Level</strong>: Adjust the number of chilies based on your heat preference. You can even add a few extra chili flakes to the dipping sauce for more spice.</li></ul><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Salt and Pepper Squid is one of the easiest yet most flavorful dishes to make at home, and it’s a perfect way to bring the authentic taste of Chinese street food into your kitchen. By following these simple steps, you’ll be able to prepare a crispy, aromatic, and spicy dish that’s sure to impress your family and friends. Whether you’re preparing it as a snack, appetizer, or a full meal, this dish is a great addition to any dinner table.</p><p>The crispy squid with its fragrant seasoning, accompanied by the optional dipping sauce, is a true Chinese culinary delight.
