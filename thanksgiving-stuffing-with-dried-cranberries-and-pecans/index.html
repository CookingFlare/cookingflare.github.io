Among the many dishes that grace the Thanksgiving table, stuffing (or dressing, depending on where you&rsquo;re from) is a classic side dish that has been a staple for generations. While traditional stuffing recipes are beloved by many, this Thanksgiving, why not add a unique twist to your stuffing by incorporating dried cranberries and pecans?

Most of these ingredients are staples in any stuffing recipe, with the addition of dried cranberries and pecans bringing that extra flair.</p><h3 id=for-the-stuffing-base>For the Stuffing Base:</h3><ul><li>1 loaf of day-old bread (preferably a hearty, rustic bread like sourdough or French bread)</li><li>2 cups vegetable broth (or chicken broth if you prefer)</li><li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li><li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li><li>2 celery stalks, finely chopped</li><li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>1 teaspoon dried sage</li><li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li><li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li><li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li><li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-cranberry-pecan-twist>For the Cranberry-Pecan Twist:</h3><ul><li>1 cup dried cranberries</li><li>1 cup pecans, roughly chopped (toasted for extra flavor)</li><li>1 tablespoon olive oil or butter (for toasting the pecans)</li></ul><h3 id=optional-ingredients-for-extra-flavor>Optional Ingredients for Extra Flavor:</h3><ul><li>1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li><li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon (adds a subtle warmth)</li><li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (to enhance the seasonal flavor)</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-make-thanksgiving-stuffing-with-dried-cranberries-and-pecans>How to Make Thanksgiving Stuffing with Dried Cranberries and Pecans</h2><p>Now that you’ve gathered your ingredients, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and get cooking! Follow these simple steps to create a stuffing that’s sure to impress:</p><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-bread>Step 1: Prepare the Bread</h3><p>The foundation of any great stuffing is the bread. Start by cutting your loaf of bread into cubes, making sure they’re roughly uniform in size. If you don’t have day-old bread, you can dry it out by placing the cubes on a baking sheet and toasting them in a 300°F (150°C) oven for about 10-15 minutes. This helps the bread absorb the flavorful broth without becoming soggy.</p><h3 id=step-2-toast-the-pecans>Step 2: Toast the Pecans</h3><p>To bring out the natural flavor of the pecans, toast them before adding them to the stuffing. Simply heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the pecans. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 5-7 minutes, or until they become fragrant and lightly browned. If you’re using butter for this step, melt it in the pan before adding the pecans for an added layer of richness. Once toasted, set the pecans aside to cool.</p><h3 id=step-3-sauté-the-vegetables>Step 3: Sauté the Vegetables</h3><p>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onions, celery, and garlic. Sauté them for about 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft and the onions become translucent. Add the dried sage, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine and let the herbs bloom in the hot butter for another 1-2 minutes. This step infuses the butter with the savory aroma of the herbs and sets the flavor base for the stuffing.</p><h3 id=step-4-assemble-the-stuffing>Step 4: Assemble the Stuffing</h3><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the toasted bread cubes, sautéed vegetables, and dried cranberries. Stir gently to combine. Add the vegetable (or chicken) broth to the mixture, a little at a time, until the bread has absorbed the liquid and is slightly moist but not soggy. You may not need to use all of the broth, so add it gradually and check the consistency as you go.</p><h3 id=step-5-add-the-toasted-pecans>Step 5: Add the Toasted Pecans</h3><p>Next, fold in the toasted pecans, making sure they’re evenly distributed throughout the stuffing. The pecans will add a delightful crunch and nutty flavor that complements the savory and sweet ingredients.</p><h3 id=step-6-bake-the-stuffing>Step 6: Bake the Stuffing</h3><p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Transfer the stuffing mixture to a greased 9x13-inch baking dish, pressing it down gently to compact it. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25-30 minutes. This allows the stuffing to cook through and become tender.</p><p>After 25-30 minutes, remove the foil and bake the stuffing uncovered for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the top becomes golden and slightly crispy. The final result should be a beautiful stuffing with a crispy, golden crust and a soft, flavorful interior.</p><h3 id=step-7-serve-and-garnish>Step 7: Serve and Garnish</h3><p>Once your Thanksgiving stuffing is baked to perfection, remove it from the oven and let it sit for a few minutes before serving. Garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color and freshness. The cranberries will have softened, the pecans will retain their crunchy texture, and the bread will be perfectly infused with the savory herbs and broth.</p><h2 id=why-this-stuffing-is-the-ultimate-holiday-side-dish>Why This Stuffing is the Ultimate Holiday Side Dish</h2><p>This Thanksgiving Stuffing with Dried Cranberries and Pecans is the perfect balance of flavors and textures. The sweetness of the cranberries contrasts beautifully with the rich, savory stuffing, while the toasted pecans add a satisfying crunch. Whether served as a side dish alongside turkey, ham, or vegetarian options, this stuffing pairs wonderfully with a variety of main courses.</p><h3 id=versatile-and-adaptable>Versatile and Adaptable</h3><p>One of the best things about this recipe is its versatility. You can easily make it your own by adding or omitting ingredients based on your preferences. For example, you could substitute walnuts for pecans, or add other seasonal fruits like apples or pears for an extra touch of sweetness. If you prefer a gluten-free option, simply swap out the bread for a gluten-free variety.</p><p>You can also make this stuffing ahead of time! Prepare it the day before Thanksgiving, store it in the refrigerator, and bake it the next day. This makes for a less stressful holiday and allows you to focus on other dishes.</p><h3 id=a-perfect-make-ahead-dish>A Perfect Make-Ahead Dish</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re planning a big Thanksgiving meal, making stuffing ahead of time is a lifesaver. Prepare the stuffing up to the point of baking and then refrigerate it overnight. On Thanksgiving day, simply pop it in the oven and bake it until golden. It’s an easy way to save time while ensuring your stuffing is fresh and delicious when it’s time to serve.</p><h2 id=final-thoughts-on-thanksgiving-stuffing-with-dried-cranberries-and-pecans>Final Thoughts on Thanksgiving Stuffing with Dried Cranberries and Pecans</h2><p>This Thanksgiving Stuffing with Dried Cranberries and Pecans is a modern twist on a classic dish that will delight your guests and elevate your holiday spread.
