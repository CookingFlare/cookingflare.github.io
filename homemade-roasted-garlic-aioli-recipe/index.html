Whether you&rsquo;re pairing it with crispy fries, roasted vegetables, or using it as a spread on sandwiches, its rich, garlicky flavor elevates any meal. While aioli is traditionally made with garlic, olive oil, and egg yolks, we’re going to put a delicious twist on this simple recipe by adding roasted garlic. Roasting garlic enhances its natural sweetness and mellows out the sharpness, creating a more complex, smooth, and savory aioli.</p><p>In this recipe, you’ll learn how to make homemade roasted garlic aioli from scratch. With just a few ingredients and easy steps, you’ll be able to whip up this creamy, garlicky delight to complement a variety of dishes. Let’s dive in and explore how to create this irresistible spread!</p><h2 id=what-is-roasted-garlic-aioli>What is Roasted Garlic Aioli?</h2><p>Aioli is a traditional sauce that originated in the Mediterranean, particularly in countries like Spain, France, and Italy. The word “aioli” is derived from the Catalan language, where &ldquo;ai&rdquo; means garlic and &ldquo;oli&rdquo; means oil. Traditionally, it was made by crushing garlic and mixing it with olive oil to form a thick paste, often emulsified with egg yolks to create a creamy texture.</p><p>Roasted garlic aioli, however, takes this classic condiment up a notch. Roasting garlic changes its flavor profile entirely. The intense pungency of raw garlic becomes soft and caramelized, with a deep sweetness and an earthy taste that adds complexity to your aioli. This roasted garlic aioli has a smooth, velvety texture with a more subtle, sweet, and rich flavor that makes it stand out.</p><h3 id=why-you-should-make-roasted-garlic-aioli-at-home>Why You Should Make Roasted Garlic Aioli at Home</h3><p>Making roasted garlic aioli at home offers several advantages:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Control Over Ingredients</strong>: When you make aioli from scratch, you have full control over the quality and quantity of the ingredients. You can select the best olive oil, adjust the amount of garlic, and even experiment with additional seasonings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Freshness</strong>: Homemade aioli is always fresher than store-bought versions. You can prepare it in small batches, ensuring the flavors are at their peak.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customization</strong>: You can easily customize the aioli to suit your tastes. Want it spicier? Add some chili flakes. Prefer a tangy kick? A squeeze of lemon will do the trick.</p></li><li><p><strong>No Preservatives</strong>: Unlike store-bought aioli, which often contains preservatives and additives, homemade aioli is free from any artificial ingredients, giving you a cleaner and more natural condiment.</p></li></ol><p>Now that you understand the benefits, let&rsquo;s get started with the recipe!</p><h2 id=ingredients-for-homemade-roasted-garlic-aioli>Ingredients for Homemade Roasted Garlic Aioli</h2><p>This recipe uses simple and fresh ingredients to create a flavorful and creamy aioli.

Here’s how you can make this deliciously creamy and savory aioli:</p><h3 id=step-1-roast-the-garlic>Step 1: Roast the Garlic</h3><p>The first step in creating roasted garlic aioli is to roast the garlic. Roasting garlic gives it a mild, sweet flavor that will shine through in the aioli. Here’s how to do it:</p><ol><li><strong>Prepare the garlic</strong>: Cut off the top of the garlic head, exposing the individual cloves. You don’t need to peel them.</li><li><strong>Wrap in foil</strong>: Place the garlic head on a piece of aluminum foil, drizzle a small amount of olive oil over it, and wrap it tightly.</li><li><strong>Roast in the oven</strong>: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place the wrapped garlic head on a baking sheet and roast it for about 35-40 minutes. The garlic will become soft, golden, and aromatic.</li><li><strong>Cool and squeeze</strong>: Once the garlic is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes. When it’s cool enough to handle, squeeze the roasted garlic cloves out of their skins. You should have a smooth, caramelized paste.</li></ol><h3 id=step-2-prepare-the-aioli-base>Step 2: Prepare the Aioli Base</h3><p>Now it’s time to create the creamy aioli base. You’ll combine the roasted garlic with egg yolk, mustard, and lemon juice to create an emulsified mixture.</p><ol><li><strong>Combine the egg yolk, mustard, and lemon juice</strong>: In a blender or food processor, add the egg yolk, Dijon mustard, and lemon juice. Blend for a few seconds to combine everything well.</li><li><strong>Add the roasted garlic</strong>: Add the roasted garlic cloves into the mixture. Blend until the garlic is fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth.</li></ol><h3 id=step-3-emulsify-the-mixture>Step 3: Emulsify the Mixture</h3><p>This is the critical step for achieving the thick and creamy texture that aioli is known for. Emulsifying the oil with the egg yolk and other ingredients creates a stable, creamy consistency.</p><ol><li><strong>Slowly add the olive oil</strong>: With the blender or food processor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil, a few drops at a time. As you continue to add the oil, you’ll notice the mixture thickening and emulsifying into a creamy aioli.</li><li><strong>Season to taste</strong>: Once all the olive oil is incorporated, taste your aioli. Add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. You can also add optional ingredients at this stage, such as smoked paprika or herbs, for an extra layer of flavor.</li></ol><h3 id=step-4-adjust-the-consistency-and-flavor>Step 4: Adjust the Consistency and Flavor</h3><p>If you find that your aioli is too thick, you can thin it out by adding a little water or extra lemon juice, one teaspoon at a time, until you reach your desired consistency. If you prefer a tangier flavor, add more lemon juice or a splash of white wine vinegar.</p><h3 id=step-5-chill-and-serve>Step 5: Chill and Serve</h3><p>Once your roasted garlic aioli is finished, transfer it to a small bowl or container and cover it. Refrigerate the aioli for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Homemade aioli tastes best when it’s allowed to sit for a little while, as the garlic and other ingredients have time to marry.</p><p>Serve your homemade aioli with your favorite dishes! It’s perfect as a dip for fries, veggies, or roasted potatoes, or as a spread on sandwiches, burgers, or wraps.</p><h2 id=tips-for-making-perfect-roasted-garlic-aioli>Tips for Making Perfect Roasted Garlic Aioli</h2><ul><li><strong>Use room temperature ingredients</strong>: Make sure your egg yolk is at room temperature. Cold ingredients can prevent the emulsion from forming properly, leading to a broken aioli.</li><li><strong>Roast extra garlic</strong>: If you love the taste of roasted garlic, consider roasting an extra head of garlic. You can freeze it for future use or add it to other dishes like pasta or soups.</li><li><strong>Don’t rush the oil</strong>: When emulsifying the oil into the egg yolk mixture, take your time. Adding the oil too quickly can result in a broken aioli.</li><li><strong>Choose high-quality olive oil</strong>: Since olive oil is the base of the aioli, the quality of the oil will significantly impact the flavor. Choose an extra virgin olive oil with a good flavor profile for the best result.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-store-roasted-garlic-aioli>How to Store Roasted Garlic Aioli</h2><p>Homemade aioli is best enjoyed within a few days of making it. Store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator, where it will keep for up to 4-5 days. As with any homemade mayo-based spread, make sure it stays refrigerated at all times to maintain its freshness and prevent any food safety issues.</p><p>If you want to store it for longer, consider freezing portions of it in an ice cube tray. Once frozen, transfer the aioli cubes to a ziplock bag or airtight container and keep them in the freezer for up to 2 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before using.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>This homemade roasted garlic aioli recipe is easy to make, bursting with flavor, and versatile enough to complement a variety of dishes.
