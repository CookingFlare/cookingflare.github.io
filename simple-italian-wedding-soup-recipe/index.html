Now, let’s get into the step-by-step process!</p><h2 id=step-by-step-instructions>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-meatballs>Step 1: Prepare the Meatballs</h3><p>The meatballs are the heart of this dish, and they’re surprisingly easy to make. To start, grab a large bowl and combine the ground beef, breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese, fresh parsley, egg, garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, and basil. Mix everything together until well combined. You can use your hands to make sure the ingredients are evenly distributed, but avoid overworking the meat, as it can result in tough meatballs.</p><p>Once everything is mixed, roll the mixture into small meatballs, about 1 inch in diameter. Place the meatballs on a baking sheet or plate, ready to be cooked. Depending on your preference, you can either pan-fry the meatballs or bake them. For the healthiest option, baking them in the oven works perfectly and allows them to cook evenly without extra oil.</p><h3 id=step-2-cooking-the-meatballs>Step 2: Cooking the Meatballs</h3><p>To cook the meatballs, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the meatballs on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake them for about 15-20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and fully cooked through. If you prefer to pan-fry them, heat a small amount of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the meatballs in batches, turning them until they are brown on all sides and cooked through.</p><p>After the meatballs are cooked, set them aside while you prepare the soup base.</p><h3 id=step-3-prepare-the-soup-base>Step 3: Prepare the Soup Base</h3><p>In a large soup pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté the vegetables for about 5-7 minutes, or until they begin to soften and the onion becomes translucent.</p><p>Once the vegetables are softened, add the chicken broth to the pot. Stir in the salt, pepper, oregano, and thyme. Bring the broth to a gentle boil, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. This allows the flavors of the vegetables and herbs to meld together and create a fragrant, flavorful base.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-the-pasta-and-meatballs>Step 4: Add the Pasta and Meatballs</h3><p>Once the broth has simmered, it’s time to add the pasta. Add the small pasta to the pot and let it cook in the broth for about 8-10 minutes, or until it’s al dente. Be sure to stir occasionally to prevent the pasta from sticking together.</p><p>After the pasta is cooked, add the meatballs to the pot, gently stirring them into the soup. Let the soup simmer for another 5 minutes, allowing the meatballs to warm through and absorb some of the flavors from the broth.</p><h3 id=step-5-add-the-greens>Step 5: Add the Greens</h3><p>Next, add the fresh spinach (or escarole) to the pot. Stir until the greens wilt and become tender, which should take about 2-3 minutes. The greens add a lovely contrast to the rich broth and provide a fresh, vibrant flavor to the soup.</p><h3 id=step-6-final-adjustments>Step 6: Final Adjustments</h3><p>Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning if needed. Depending on your preference, you may want to add a little more salt, pepper, or herbs to bring out the flavors. If you’d like a bit more richness, feel free to stir in some extra Parmesan cheese at this stage.</p><p>Once you’re happy with the taste, remove the pot from the heat. Your Italian Wedding Soup is now ready to serve!</p><h2 id=serving-suggestions>Serving Suggestions</h2><p>Italian Wedding Soup is perfect on its own, but you can elevate it further with a few simple additions. Serve it with a side of crusty bread for dipping, or perhaps a small bowl of mixed olives for an added Mediterranean touch. A light green salad with a simple vinaigrette pairs beautifully with the soup, offering a refreshing contrast to the richness of the dish.</p><p>For an extra touch of flavor, garnish each bowl with a sprinkle of freshly grated Parmesan cheese or a few fresh basil leaves. This adds both color and an extra layer of flavor to the dish, making it even more irresistible.</p><h2 id=tips-for-making-the-best-italian-wedding-soup>Tips for Making the Best Italian Wedding Soup</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Make-Ahead Option</strong>: Italian Wedding Soup can be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. The flavors continue to develop and meld together, making it even tastier the next day. If you have leftover soup, store the pasta and meatballs separately from the broth to prevent the pasta from becoming too soft.</p></li><li><p><strong>Freezing</strong>: If you want to freeze this soup for future use, it’s best to freeze the broth and meatballs separately from the pasta. This helps preserve the texture of the pasta, as it can become mushy when frozen and reheated.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customizing Your Soup</strong>: Feel free to experiment with different greens in your Italian Wedding Soup. While spinach is commonly used, escarole is the traditional green in many versions of the recipe. You could also try adding kale for a heartier, more robust flavor. If you prefer a vegetarian version, omit the meatballs and use vegetable broth as the base.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spicy Kick</strong>: If you enjoy a bit of spice, consider adding a pinch of red pepper flakes to the broth or sprinkling some on top of the soup when serving. This adds a subtle heat that complements the richness of the meatballs and the vegetables.</p></li></ul><h2 id=why-youll-love-this-recipe>Why You’ll Love This Recipe</h2><p>Italian Wedding Soup is a comforting and satisfying dish that combines the perfect balance of flavors and textures.
