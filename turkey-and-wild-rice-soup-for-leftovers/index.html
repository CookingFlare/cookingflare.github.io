After preparing a large turkey for a holiday feast, you’ll often have plenty of meat left over. Instead of letting it go to waste, repurpose it into a delicious soup.

Here’s how to make this comforting dish from start to finish:</p><h3 id=step-1-sauté-the-vegetables>Step 1: Sauté the Vegetables</h3><p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, melt the butter over medium heat. Once the butter is melted and bubbly, add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté the vegetables for about 5-7 minutes, or until they begin to soften. Stir occasionally to ensure they cook evenly.</p><p>Add the minced garlic to the pot and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant. Garlic can burn quickly, so keep an eye on it and stir frequently.</p><h3 id=step-2-add-the-broth-and-seasonings>Step 2: Add the Broth and Seasonings</h3><p>Once the vegetables are softened and aromatic, pour in the turkey broth (or chicken broth if you&rsquo;re using that), and stir to combine. Add the dried thyme, dried sage, salt, black pepper, and bay leaf to the broth. Stir well to distribute the seasonings throughout the soup.</p><p>Bring the broth to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 10 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld and infuse the broth with savory goodness.</p><h3 id=step-3-add-the-turkey-and-wild-rice>Step 3: Add the Turkey and Wild Rice</h3><p>After the broth has simmered and developed flavor, add the cooked turkey and wild rice to the pot. Stir the ingredients together and allow the soup to continue simmering for an additional 10-15 minutes. This gives the turkey and wild rice time to absorb the broth’s flavors.</p><h3 id=step-4-stir-in-the-cream>Step 4: Stir in the Cream</h3><p>Once the soup has simmered and the flavors are well blended, stir in the half-and-half or heavy cream. This adds a creamy texture and richness to the soup, making it feel indulgent and comforting. Allow the soup to heat through for another 2-3 minutes, ensuring that the cream is fully incorporated.</p><h3 id=step-5-optional-add-ins>Step 5: Optional Add-ins</h3><p>If you’re adding frozen peas, corn, or other vegetables to your soup, now is the time to stir them in. Add the frozen peas and corn, and continue cooking for 5-7 minutes, until they are heated through and tender.</p><p>If you’d like to add a touch of smokiness, sprinkle in the paprika and stir to combine. This will give the soup a deeper flavor with a slight hint of smokiness that complements the turkey beautifully.</p><h3 id=step-6-taste-and-adjust-seasonings>Step 6: Taste and Adjust Seasonings</h3><p>Before serving, taste the soup and adjust the seasonings if needed. Add more salt or pepper if desired, or a dash of extra thyme or sage for additional flavor. The soup should be well-seasoned but not overpowering, allowing the delicate flavor of the turkey and the earthiness of the wild rice to shine.</p><h3 id=step-7-serve-and-enjoy>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Ladle the hot turkey and wild rice soup into bowls. Garnish with freshly grated Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of chopped parsley. Serve the soup with crusty bread or crackers for dipping, and enjoy the comforting, hearty flavors.</p><h2 id=tips-for-customizing-your-turkey-and-wild-rice-soup>Tips for Customizing Your Turkey and Wild Rice Soup</h2><p>One of the great things about turkey and wild rice soup is how adaptable it is. You can easily customize the ingredients to suit your preferences or what you have available in your kitchen. Here are a few ideas to make this soup your own:</p><h3 id=make-it-vegetarian>Make it Vegetarian</h3><p>If you want to make this soup vegetarian, you can easily swap out the turkey for mushrooms or tofu. Use vegetable broth instead of turkey or chicken broth, and add extra vegetables like zucchini, potatoes, or sweet potatoes for a filling, plant-based version.</p><h3 id=add-more-veggies>Add More Veggies</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re a fan of vegetables, consider adding more to the soup. You can throw in extra vegetables like bell peppers, green beans, or spinach. Just be sure to chop them into bite-sized pieces so they cook evenly and blend well with the other ingredients.</p><h3 id=spice-it-up>Spice it Up</h3><p>If you like a bit of heat, add some red pepper flakes or a chopped jalapeño pepper to the soup. The heat will balance out the richness of the cream and add another layer of flavor to the soup.</p><h2 id=storing-leftovers>Storing Leftovers</h2><p>This turkey and wild rice soup stores well in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Make sure to let the soup cool completely before transferring it to an airtight container. Reheat the soup on the stovetop over low heat, stirring occasionally until it’s heated through.</p><h3 id=freezing-leftovers>Freezing Leftovers</h3><p>If you want to store the soup for a longer period, you can freeze it. Allow the soup to cool completely, then transfer it to freezer-safe containers or bags. It will keep in the freezer for up to 3 months. When you&rsquo;re ready to enjoy it, thaw the soup in the refrigerator overnight and reheat on the stovetop.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Turkey and Wild Rice Soup is a satisfying, nutritious, and flavorful way to use up your leftover turkey.
