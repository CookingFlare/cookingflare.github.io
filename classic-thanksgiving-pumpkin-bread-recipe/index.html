The combination of simple pantry staples and aromatic spices comes together in the best possible way. Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll need:</p><h3 id=dry-ingredients>Dry Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li><li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li><li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li><li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li><li>1/4 teaspoon ground cloves</li><li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li><li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li></ul><h3 id=wet-ingredients>Wet Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>1 cup pure pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)</li><li>3/4 cup vegetable oil (or melted butter for a richer flavor)</li><li>2 large eggs</li><li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</li><li>1/4 cup brown sugar (light or dark)</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li></ul><h3 id=optional-add-ins>Optional Add-ins:</h3><ul><li>1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans</li><li>1/2 cup chocolate chips (for a fun twist)</li><li>1/2 cup raisins or dried cranberries (for extra texture and sweetness)</li></ul><h2 id=equipment-needed>Equipment Needed:</h2><ul><li>9x5-inch loaf pan</li><li>Mixing bowls (one for dry ingredients, one for wet ingredients)</li><li>Whisk or electric mixer</li><li>Measuring spoons and cups</li><li>Spatula</li><li>Cooling rack</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-make-classic-thanksgiving-pumpkin-bread>How to Make Classic Thanksgiving Pumpkin Bread</h2><h3 id=step-1-preheat-the-oven>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3><p>To start, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that the oven reaches the perfect temperature for baking the bread evenly. While the oven is heating up, you can move on to preparing the rest of the ingredients.</p><h3 id=step-2-prepare-the-loaf-pan>Step 2: Prepare the Loaf Pan</h3><p>Grease your 9x5-inch loaf pan with butter or cooking spray. You can also line the pan with parchment paper for easy removal of the bread once it’s baked. This simple step ensures that your pumpkin bread doesn&rsquo;t stick to the pan, allowing you to enjoy a perfect slice every time.</p><h3 id=step-3-mix-the-dry-ingredients>Step 3: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine all the dry ingredients. This includes the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, ginger, and salt. Use a whisk to thoroughly mix everything together, ensuring that the spices are evenly distributed throughout the flour. This helps in achieving an evenly spiced loaf of bread.</p><h3 id=step-4-prepare-the-wet-ingredients>Step 4: Prepare the Wet Ingredients</h3><p>In another bowl, combine the wet ingredients. Start by whisking the pumpkin puree, vegetable oil (or melted butter), eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. Whisk until the mixture is smooth and fully combined. You should have a thick, rich batter that is slightly lumpy from the pumpkin puree.</p><h3 id=step-5-combine-the-wet-and-dry-ingredients>Step 5: Combine the Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3><p>Once both the wet and dry ingredients are prepared, it’s time to bring them together. Gradually add the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, stirring gently with a spatula or a wooden spoon. Mix until everything is just combined. Be careful not to over-mix, as this could lead to a dense, tough loaf. The batter will be thick and may require a little patience to fold everything together.</p><p>If you’re adding any optional mix-ins like nuts, chocolate chips, or dried fruit, fold them in at this stage. These add-ins are completely optional but can enhance the flavor and texture of your pumpkin bread, giving it extra crunch and sweetness.</p><h3 id=step-6-pour-the-batter-into-the-loaf-pan>Step 6: Pour the Batter into the Loaf Pan</h3><p>Once the batter is ready, pour it into the prepared loaf pan. Use a spatula to spread the batter evenly in the pan, smoothing out the top. This ensures the loaf bakes evenly and has a beautiful, even rise.</p><h3 id=step-7-bake-the-pumpkin-bread>Step 7: Bake the Pumpkin Bread</h3><p>Place the loaf pan in the preheated oven and bake for 60-70 minutes. The baking time may vary depending on your oven and the type of pan you&rsquo;re using. After about 55 minutes, start checking for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center of the bread. If it comes out clean or with just a few crumbs clinging to it, the bread is done. If there’s still batter on the toothpick, continue baking for an additional 5-10 minutes.</p><h3 id=step-8-let-the-bread-cool>Step 8: Let the Bread Cool</h3><p>Once the bread is baked to perfection, remove it from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Afterward, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. This is an important step, as the bread continues to cook a bit while cooling in the pan. Letting it cool ensures it doesn&rsquo;t fall apart when sliced.</p><h3 id=step-9-slice-and-enjoy>Step 9: Slice and Enjoy</h3><p>Once your pumpkin bread has cooled completely, it’s ready to slice and enjoy! Use a sharp serrated knife to cut thick or thin slices, depending on your preference. The bread is perfect on its own or can be served with a spread of butter, cream cheese, or even a drizzle of maple syrup for an extra touch of indulgence.</p><h3 id=tips-for-the-best-pumpkin-bread>Tips for the Best Pumpkin Bread</h3><ul><li><strong>Use Fresh Pumpkin Puree</strong>: For the best flavor, use pure pumpkin puree instead of canned pumpkin pie filling. Pumpkin puree has a cleaner, more authentic flavor, which is essential for the bread&rsquo;s taste.</li><li><strong>Don’t Overmix</strong>: When combining the wet and dry ingredients, stir until just combined. Overmixing can lead to dense and tough bread.</li><li><strong>Add Ins</strong>: Customize your pumpkin bread by adding ingredients like chocolate chips, nuts, or dried fruit. These add extra flavor and texture, making each bite unique.</li><li><strong>Storage</strong>: Pumpkin bread stays moist for several days. Store it in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days, or refrigerate it for up to a week. You can also freeze it for up to three months by wrapping it tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil.</li><li><strong>Make It Ahead of Time</strong>: If you’re preparing for Thanksgiving or a busy fall weekend, make your pumpkin bread a day or two ahead of time. It stores well and the flavors will develop even more as it sits.</li></ul><h2 id=why-this-pumpkin-bread-is-perfect-for-thanksgiving>Why This Pumpkin Bread Is Perfect for Thanksgiving</h2><p>Pumpkin bread is a versatile and delightful treat that perfectly fits into the Thanksgiving spread. Whether served as part of the appetizer spread, a side dish, or a dessert, it adds a deliciously aromatic note to the table.
