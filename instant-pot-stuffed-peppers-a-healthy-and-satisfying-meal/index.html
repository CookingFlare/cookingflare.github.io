Traditional stuffed peppers usually require baking in the oven for about 45 minutes to an hour. In contrast, cooking stuffed peppers in the Instant Pot only takes about 10 minutes, making it a perfect solution for busy weeknights or when you don’t want to spend hours in the kitchen.</p><p>Moreover, using the Instant Pot helps infuse the flavors of the ingredients into the peppers while keeping them tender and juicy. Plus, the convenience of a one-pot meal means less cleanup afterward, leaving you with more time to relax and enjoy your meal.</p><h2 id=what-youll-need-for-instant-pot-stuffed-peppers>What You&rsquo;ll Need for Instant Pot Stuffed Peppers</h2><p>Before you begin, gather all of your ingredients and kitchen tools. Here’s a list of what you’ll need to create a delicious batch of Instant Pot stuffed peppers:</p><h3 id=ingredients>Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>4 large bell peppers (red, green, yellow, or orange)</li><li>1 lb ground meat (beef, turkey, chicken, or a plant-based substitute)</li><li>1 cup cooked rice (brown rice or white rice works well)</li><li>1 can diced tomatoes (14.5 oz, with juice)</li><li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li><li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li><li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li><li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li><li>½ teaspoon cumin (optional)</li><li>1 teaspoon paprika</li><li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li><li>1 cup shredded cheese (optional, for topping)</li><li>1 cup low-sodium beef or chicken broth</li></ul><h3 id=equipment>Equipment:</h3><ul><li>Instant Pot</li><li>Sharp knife</li><li>Cutting board</li><li>Spoon for stuffing peppers</li><li>Measuring spoons</li><li>Measuring cup</li></ul><h3 id=optional-garnishes>Optional Garnishes:</h3><ul><li>Fresh parsley or cilantro, chopped</li><li>Sour cream or Greek yogurt</li><li>Hot sauce for a bit of extra heat</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-make-instant-pot-stuffed-peppers>How to Make Instant Pot Stuffed Peppers</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-bell-peppers>Step 1: Prepare the Bell Peppers</h3><p>The first step is to prep your bell peppers. Start by cutting the tops off each pepper and carefully removing the seeds and membranes inside. You want to leave the peppers intact but hollowed out so you can stuff them with the filling. If the peppers are wobbly and don’t stand up straight, you can slice a small portion off the bottom to create a flat base, but be careful not to cut through the pepper’s bottom.</p><p>Once they’re prepped, set the peppers aside and move on to preparing the stuffing.</p><h3 id=step-2-cook-the-filling>Step 2: Cook the Filling</h3><p>Start by turning on the Instant Pot and setting it to &ldquo;Sauté&rdquo; mode. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pot, and once it’s hot, sauté the chopped onions and minced garlic for 2-3 minutes, or until they’re softened and fragrant.</p><p>Add the ground meat to the pot and cook it until browned, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon as it cooks. If you’re using lean meat, there won’t be much excess fat, but if you’re using a fattier meat like beef, you might want to drain some of the excess fat once the meat is browned.</p><p>Stir in the spices—oregano, basil, cumin (if using), paprika, salt, and pepper—and continue to sauté for another 1-2 minutes. This will help release the flavors from the spices, giving the filling a rich, well-rounded taste.</p><p>Next, add the diced tomatoes (with juice) to the pot. Stir everything together to combine. Then, add the cooked rice to the mixture, stirring until everything is well incorporated. The rice will help bind the filling together and add a bit of texture to the dish.</p><h3 id=step-3-stuff-the-peppers>Step 3: Stuff the Peppers</h3><p>Once the filling is ready, it’s time to stuff the peppers. Using a spoon, fill each bell pepper with the meat and rice mixture. Be sure to pack the filling tightly to avoid air pockets. If necessary, use the spoon to press down gently to ensure the peppers are stuffed to the top.</p><h3 id=step-4-prepare-the-instant-pot>Step 4: Prepare the Instant Pot</h3><p>Add the low-sodium broth to the Instant Pot, ensuring that it covers the bottom. This will help create steam and prevent the peppers from sticking or burning during cooking. Place a trivet or steamer rack into the pot, and carefully arrange the stuffed peppers on top of it. The peppers should be standing upright, with the stuffing facing up.</p><h3 id=step-5-cook-the-stuffed-peppers>Step 5: Cook the Stuffed Peppers</h3><p>Secure the lid of the Instant Pot and set the valve to the “Sealing” position. Select the “Manual” or “Pressure Cook” setting, and cook on high pressure for 10 minutes. It’s important not to overcook the peppers, as you want them to remain tender but still hold their shape.</p><p>After the cooking time is complete, allow the Instant Pot to release pressure naturally for about 5 minutes before doing a quick release to release any remaining pressure.</p><h3 id=step-6-add-cheese-optional>Step 6: Add Cheese (Optional)</h3><p>If you’re adding cheese to your stuffed peppers, now is the time! Carefully remove the peppers from the Instant Pot and place them on a serving platter. Sprinkle the shredded cheese on top of each stuffed pepper and return them to the pot. Close the lid for just a minute or two to allow the cheese to melt. Alternatively, you can place the stuffed peppers under the broiler for 1-2 minutes to get the cheese bubbly and golden brown.</p><h3 id=step-7-serve-and-enjoy>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Once the cheese has melted (if using), remove the stuffed peppers from the Instant Pot and place them on plates. Garnish with fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro and a dollop of sour cream or Greek yogurt, if desired. Serve with a side salad, steamed vegetables, or crusty bread for a complete and satisfying meal.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-instant-pot-stuffed-peppers>Tips for Perfect Instant Pot Stuffed Peppers</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Adjust the Filling</strong>: You can customize the stuffing to suit your dietary preferences. For a healthier option, you can swap out the ground meat for leaner options like turkey, chicken, or even plant-based proteins like lentils or tofu. You can also replace the rice with quinoa or cauliflower rice for a low-carb alternative.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spice It Up</strong>: If you like a bit of heat, try adding some diced jalapeños or red pepper flakes to the stuffing. Hot sauce can also be drizzled on top before serving.</p></li><li><p><strong>Meal Prep</strong>: These stuffed peppers are perfect for meal prep. You can prepare the filling ahead of time, stuff the peppers, and refrigerate them until you&rsquo;re ready to cook. When you&rsquo;re ready, just follow the Instant Pot cooking steps for a quick, hassle-free dinner.</p></li><li><p><strong>Freezing</strong>: Stuffed peppers can also be frozen for later use. After cooking, let them cool completely and wrap them individually in plastic wrap or aluminum foil before storing them in a freezer bag. To reheat, simply thaw the peppers overnight in the refrigerator and then reheat in the Instant Pot or oven.</p></li></ul><h2 id=nutritional-benefits-of-instant-pot-stuffed-peppers>Nutritional Benefits of Instant Pot Stuffed Peppers</h2><p>Stuffed peppers are not only delicious but also packed with nutritional benefits. Here are some reasons why they make for a healthy meal choice:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rich in Protein</strong>: The ground meat (or plant-based protein) provides a good source of protein, essential for muscle repair and immune function.</p></li><li><p><strong>High in Fiber</strong>: Rice (especially brown rice) is a great source of fiber, which helps promote digestion and keeps you feeling full longer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Loaded with Vegetables</strong>: Bell peppers are packed with vitamins A and C, which are essential for maintaining a healthy immune system and promoting healthy skin.</p></li><li><p><strong>Low in Carbs (When Substituted)</strong>: For those following a low-carb or keto diet, substituting rice with cauliflower rice or quinoa will significantly reduce the carbohydrate content of the meal.</p></li></ul><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Instant Pot stuffed peppers offer a quick, healthy, and satisfying meal that’s perfect for busy families or anyone looking to enjoy a nutritious dinner without spending hours in the kitchen.
