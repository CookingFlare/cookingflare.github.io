Whether you&rsquo;re serving it as a side to your favorite curry, using it as a wrap for a sandwich, or simply enjoying it with a dollop of hummus or yogurt, flatbread is a crowd-pleaser. What makes this recipe even more exciting is the use of yogurt, which not only adds richness but also makes the flatbread soft and chewy.</p><p>In this recipe, we’re going to walk you through making a quick and easy flatbread with yogurt. This recipe requires minimal ingredients and can be prepared in no time, making it perfect for weeknight dinners, weekend get-togethers, or even a quick snack.</p><h2 id=ingredients>Ingredients</h2><p>To make your homemade flatbread, you&rsquo;ll need just a few simple ingredients that are likely already in your pantry. Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll need:</p><ul><li><strong>1 cup of plain yogurt</strong> (Greek or regular)</li><li><strong>2 cups all-purpose flour</strong>, plus extra for rolling</li><li><strong>1 tablespoon olive oil</strong> (or any cooking oil of your choice)</li><li><strong>1 teaspoon salt</strong></li><li><strong>1 teaspoon baking powder</strong></li><li><strong>Water</strong>, as needed (about 2-3 tablespoons)</li></ul><p>These ingredients come together to create the perfect balance of flavors and textures in your flatbread. The yogurt helps bind the dough, creating a smooth, pliable texture, while the baking powder ensures your flatbread rises lightly when cooking.</p><h2 id=preparation>Preparation</h2><h3 id=step-1-mixing-the-ingredients>Step 1: Mixing the Ingredients</h3><p>Start by mixing the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Combine the all-purpose flour, salt, and baking powder. Mix them thoroughly to ensure even distribution of the baking powder and salt.</p><p>Once the dry ingredients are mixed, add the plain yogurt to the bowl. Stir the mixture using a spoon or your hands until the yogurt begins to combine with the flour. You’ll notice that the dough will begin to come together.</p><p>If the dough feels too dry, add a little water, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches a soft but not sticky consistency. You want a dough that holds together well but isn’t too wet. If it’s too sticky, add a little more flour to adjust the texture.</p><p>Add the olive oil to the mixture to help make the dough soft and smooth. The oil also adds flavor, and it helps the flatbread stay tender.</p><h3 id=step-2-kneading-the-dough>Step 2: Kneading the Dough</h3><p>Once the dough starts to come together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead it for about 5-7 minutes. Kneading helps to develop the gluten, which will give your flatbread a chewy texture. If the dough sticks to your hands or the counter, sprinkle it lightly with flour.</p><p>Continue kneading until the dough is smooth and elastic. If you press your finger into the dough, it should spring back. Once you achieve this consistency, shape the dough into a ball.</p><h3 id=step-3-resting-the-dough>Step 3: Resting the Dough</h3><p>Allow the dough to rest for about 15-20 minutes. Cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap to prevent it from drying out. Resting the dough allows the gluten to relax, which will make it easier to roll out and result in a more tender flatbread.</p><h3 id=step-4-rolling-out-the-dough>Step 4: Rolling Out the Dough</h3><p>Once your dough has rested, divide it into smaller portions. This recipe will make about 6-8 small flatbreads, depending on the size you prefer. Roll each portion into a ball and then flatten it out with a rolling pin. Roll the dough to about 1/8 inch thickness.</p><p>While rolling, sprinkle a little flour on your work surface to keep the dough from sticking. Don’t worry about making perfectly round shapes—rustic, uneven edges add to the charm of homemade flatbread!</p><h3 id=step-5-cooking-the-flatbreads>Step 5: Cooking the Flatbreads</h3><p>Now that your flatbread is rolled out and ready, it’s time to cook it. Heat a large skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat. No oil is necessary, as the dough has olive oil incorporated into it.</p><p>Place one flatbread at a time in the hot skillet. Cook for about 1-2 minutes on one side, or until you see bubbles forming on the surface. Flip the flatbread over and cook the other side for another 1-2 minutes, or until it has golden brown spots and looks slightly puffed.</p><p>Repeat the process with each piece of dough. Make sure your pan is hot but not smoking, as too much heat will burn the bread before it cooks through.</p><p>If you prefer an extra crispy flatbread, you can brush the cooked flatbread with a little more olive oil and return it to the skillet for a quick sear.</p><h3 id=step-6-serving>Step 6: Serving</h3><p>Your flatbread is now ready to be served! You can enjoy it immediately while it’s still warm, or you can store it for later. If you’re not eating it right away, place the cooked flatbread on a wire rack to cool slightly before wrapping it in a clean kitchen towel. This helps maintain its softness.</p><p>Flatbread with yogurt can be served in many ways. Here are a few ideas:</p><ul><li><strong>As a side</strong>: Pair it with your favorite curry, stew, or soup.</li><li><strong>As a wrap</strong>: Fill it with grilled chicken, veggies, or falafel, and drizzle with tahini or yogurt-based sauce.</li><li><strong>With dips</strong>: Serve alongside hummus, tzatziki, or baba ganoush.</li><li><strong>For breakfast</strong>: Spread with butter or jam, or enjoy it with a soft-boiled egg.</li></ul><p>The possibilities are endless, and the flatbread’s neutral flavor will complement a wide range of dishes.</p><h2 id=tips-and-variations>Tips and Variations</h2><ul><li><strong>For Fluffier Flatbread</strong>: Add a little more baking powder to the dough. This will make the flatbread rise more and become slightly puffier when cooked.</li><li><strong>Add Herbs or Spices</strong>: Customize your flatbread by incorporating herbs like rosemary, thyme, or garlic powder into the dough. Fresh herbs like chopped cilantro or parsley can also be sprinkled on top before serving.</li><li><strong>Yogurt Options</strong>: You can use any type of plain yogurt, but for a thicker and richer texture, Greek yogurt works especially well. If you&rsquo;re looking for a dairy-free option, try using coconut yogurt or almond milk yogurt.</li><li><strong>Make It Sweet</strong>: For a dessert version, add a tablespoon of sugar to the dough, and serve with honey and fruit.</li></ul><h2 id=health-benefits-of-yogurt-in-flatbread>Health Benefits of Yogurt in Flatbread</h2><p>In addition to adding flavor and texture, yogurt offers several health benefits when included in your flatbread recipe.</p><ul><li><strong>Protein</strong>: Yogurt is a great source of protein, which helps in muscle repair and growth. It also keeps you feeling full for longer.</li><li><strong>Calcium</strong>: Yogurt is rich in calcium, an essential mineral for bone health.</li><li><strong>Probiotics</strong>: If you use live cultures, yogurt contains probiotics that can support your digestive system and immune health.</li><li><strong>Vitamins</strong>: Yogurt provides vitamins such as B12, riboflavin, and phosphorus, all of which play a role in maintaining overall health.</li></ul><p>Incorporating yogurt into your flatbread not only enhances its flavor but also adds nutritional value, making it a healthy and satisfying choice for any meal.</p><h2 id=storing-leftovers>Storing Leftovers</h2><p>If you have any leftover flatbread (which is rare because it’s so delicious!), you can store it for later. Allow the flatbread to cool completely before placing it in an airtight container. It can be kept at room temperature for up to 2 days, or you can refrigerate it for up to a week.</p><p>To reheat, warm it in a skillet for a minute or so on each side, or you can microwave it for 20-30 seconds. If you want to keep it fresh for even longer, freeze the flatbread. Simply place a piece of parchment paper between each flatbread and store them in a freezer-safe bag. They will keep for up to 3 months.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Making your own flatbread with yogurt is incredibly simple and rewarding. With minimal ingredients and just a few steps, you can create fresh, soft, and flavorful flatbreads that will complement a variety of dishes. Whether you&rsquo;re looking to impress guests at your next dinner party or enjoy a quick snack, this easy flatbread recipe is sure to become a staple in your kitchen.</p><p>The beauty of this recipe lies in its versatility—you can tailor it to your taste preferences, experiment with different flavors, and enjoy it in many different ways. Plus, it&rsquo;s a healthier alternative to store-bought flatbreads, and it’s a great way to incorporate the benefits of yogurt into your diet.</p><p>Happy cooking, and enjoy your homemade flatbread with yogurt!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/categories/pizza-and-flatbreads/>Pizza and Flatbreads</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/easy-flatbread-pizza-with-spinach-and-goat-cheese/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Easy Flatbread Pizza with Spinach and Goat Cheese</span>
