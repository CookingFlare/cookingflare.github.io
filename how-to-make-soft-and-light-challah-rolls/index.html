Whether served on Shabbat, special holidays, or simply enjoyed as a comforting snack, the soft, fluffy, and slightly sweet texture of challah is unmatched. While making a full-sized challah loaf is a wonderful experience, sometimes you want something a little more bite-sized. Enter challah rolls—mini versions of the classic braided bread that are just as rich, tender, and perfect for any occasion. In this recipe, we’ll guide you through the process of making soft, light challah rolls that will be the highlight of any meal.</p><h2 id=ingredients-for-soft-and-light-challah-rolls>Ingredients for Soft and Light Challah Rolls</h2><p>Before starting, gather the following ingredients:</p><ul><li><strong>4 cups all-purpose flour</strong>, plus more for dusting</li><li><strong>1/4 cup granulated sugar</strong></li><li><strong>2 teaspoons salt</strong></li><li><strong>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</strong></li><li><strong>3/4 cup warm water</strong> (about 110°F/43°C)</li><li><strong>1/4 cup vegetable oil</strong> (or any neutral oil)</li><li><strong>3 large eggs</strong> (2 for the dough and 1 for egg wash)</li><li><strong>1 tablespoon honey</strong> (optional for extra sweetness)</li><li><strong>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</strong> (optional for a touch of flavor)</li><li><strong>Sesame seeds or poppy seeds</strong> (for topping, optional)</li><li><strong>1 tablespoon water</strong> (for egg wash)</li></ul><p>This list of ingredients will create 12 to 15 rolls, depending on the size. You can adjust the quantities accordingly if you&rsquo;re planning to make more or fewer rolls.</p><h3 id=the-key-to-soft-fluffy-challah-rolls>The Key to Soft, Fluffy Challah Rolls</h3><p>The secret to achieving soft and fluffy challah rolls lies in the dough-making process. The perfect balance of ingredients, proper kneading, and the right amount of rise time are essential. Let’s walk through these crucial steps for success.</p><h2 id=step-by-step-instructions>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2><h3 id=step-1-activate-the-yeast>Step 1: Activate the Yeast</h3><p>Start by activating the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm water and granulated sugar. Stir to dissolve the sugar, and then sprinkle the yeast over the surface of the water. Let it sit for about 5–10 minutes until it becomes foamy. This step ensures that your yeast is alive and ready to make the dough rise. If the mixture doesn&rsquo;t foam, you may need to start over with fresh yeast.</p><h3 id=step-2-combine-dry-ingredients>Step 2: Combine Dry Ingredients</h3><p>While the yeast is activating, in a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Once the yeast mixture is ready, pour it into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Add the vegetable oil, two eggs (be sure to reserve one egg for the egg wash), honey, and vanilla extract. Use a wooden spoon or your hands to mix everything together.</p><h3 id=step-3-knead-the-dough>Step 3: Knead the Dough</h3><p>Once the ingredients are mostly combined, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Begin kneading the dough by folding it over and pushing it down with the palms of your hands. Keep kneading for about 8-10 minutes, adding small amounts of flour if the dough is too sticky. The dough should become smooth, elastic, and slightly tacky but not overly sticky. If the dough feels too dry, you can add a bit more warm water (a teaspoon at a time) to achieve the right consistency.</p><h3 id=step-4-first-rise>Step 4: First Rise</h3><p>Once the dough is kneaded, place it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover it with a damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Let the dough rise in a warm area for 1–1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size. The warm, humid environment helps the dough rise effectively, so find a cozy spot in your kitchen—an oven with the light on or near a sunny window works well.</p><h3 id=step-5-shape-the-rolls>Step 5: Shape the Rolls</h3><p>Once the dough has doubled in size, gently punch it down to release any excess air. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide it into equal portions, roughly the size of a golf ball. Roll each piece of dough into a smooth ball and place them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Be sure to leave a bit of space between each roll, as they will expand during the second rise.</p><p>For added visual appeal, you can lightly roll each piece into a mini log, then twist or braid them before placing them on the baking sheet. While braiding is optional, it gives the rolls a classic challah look and an extra touch of elegance.</p><h3 id=step-6-second-rise>Step 6: Second Rise</h3><p>Cover the rolls loosely with a clean kitchen towel and allow them to rise for an additional 30–45 minutes. During this time, the rolls will puff up, becoming light and airy. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) during this stage so that it’s ready when the rolls are fully risen.</p><h3 id=step-7-egg-wash-for-shine-and-color>Step 7: Egg Wash for Shine and Color</h3><p>While the rolls are rising, prepare the egg wash. In a small bowl, beat the remaining egg with 1 tablespoon of water until smooth. Once the rolls have risen, gently brush the tops with the egg wash. This step will give the challah rolls a beautiful golden-brown color and a shiny, appetizing finish. If you like, sprinkle sesame seeds or poppy seeds on top for extra texture and flavor.</p><h3 id=step-8-bake-the-rolls>Step 8: Bake the Rolls</h3><p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the challah rolls for 20-25 minutes or until they are golden brown on top. To ensure they are fully baked, you can tap the bottom of one of the rolls—it should sound hollow when done. The internal temperature of the rolls should reach around 190°F (88°C). Keep an eye on them towards the end of baking to prevent over-browning.</p><h3 id=step-9-cool-and-serve>Step 9: Cool and Serve</h3><p>Once the rolls are perfectly golden, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool slightly on a wire rack. Challah rolls are best enjoyed fresh out of the oven, but you can also store them in an airtight container for up to 3 days. For a warm treat, simply reheat them in the oven for a few minutes before serving.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-challah-rolls>Tips for Perfect Challah Rolls</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Use the right flour</strong>: While all-purpose flour works well, you can also experiment with bread flour for a slightly chewier texture.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t rush the rise</strong>: Giving the dough enough time to rise is key to achieving the light and airy texture that makes challah rolls so special. If you&rsquo;re in a hurry, you can try using a warmer environment, like placing the dough in an oven with the light on, to speed up the process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Knead thoroughly</strong>: Kneading is essential for developing gluten in the dough, which gives it structure and texture. Make sure to knead for at least 8–10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Egg wash for color and texture</strong>: The egg wash not only gives the rolls a beautiful shine but also helps achieve a slightly crisp crust. If you want a softer crust, you can skip the egg wash or brush the rolls with a little melted butter after baking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make-ahead option</strong>: If you&rsquo;d like to prepare the dough in advance, you can refrigerate it after the first rise. Punch down the dough, shape it into rolls, and let them rise in the fridge overnight. The next day, simply continue with the second rise and baking process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Experiment with flavors</strong>: Challah rolls are versatile and can be flavored with different ingredients. Try adding a little orange zest or cinnamon to the dough for a twist on the classic recipe. If you prefer a savory roll, you can add minced garlic, rosemary, or olives to the dough before shaping.</p></li></ol><h2 id=why-youll-love-these-challah-rolls>Why You’ll Love These Challah Rolls</h2><p>Challah rolls have everything that makes the classic challah so beloved, but in a more portable, bite-sized form.
