Drinks like the Martini, Margarita, Old Fashioned, and Mojito are staples of any well-stocked bar. But there are countless other timeless concoctions that deserve more attention. These underrated classics not only provide a refreshing change of pace but also introduce a new layer of flavor to your drinking experience. Today, we&rsquo;re going to take a deep dive into some of the most underrated classic cocktails that you absolutely need to try.</p><h2 id=1-the-paper-plane>1. The Paper Plane</h2><h3 id=the-origins>The Origins</h3><p>The Paper Plane is a relatively recent classic compared to many other cocktails on this list. Created in 2008 by bartender Sam Ross at the Aviary in Chicago, this drink blends a balance of sour, bitter, and sweet flavors in a way that’s both refreshing and complex. The Paper Plane is named after the iconic paper airplane, which symbolizes its light and approachable nature, despite the depth of flavors within the glass.</p><h3 id=ingredients>Ingredients</h3><ul><li>3/4 oz Bourbon</li><li>3/4 oz Aperol</li><li>3/4 oz Amaro Nonino</li><li>3/4 oz fresh lemon juice</li></ul><h3 id=method>Method</h3><p>Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into a coupe glass. Serve straight up, garnished with a thin slice of lemon peel.</p><h3 id=why-you-should-try-it>Why You Should Try It</h3><p>The Paper Plane offers a sophisticated balance of flavors, with the smoothness of bourbon, the bitterness of Aperol, and the herbal depth of Amaro Nonino. Its well-rounded profile makes it an easy-drinking yet complex cocktail that&rsquo;s perfect for almost any occasion. The simplicity in its ingredients allows each one to shine without overwhelming the drinker, making it a fantastic choice for anyone looking to explore new cocktails without venturing too far from the familiar.</p><hr><h2 id=2-the-bees-knees>2. The Bees Knees</h2><h3 id=the-origins-1>The Origins</h3><p>Dating back to the Prohibition era, the Bees Knees is one of the many gin-based drinks that saw a resurgence in popularity in the early 20th century. The name itself comes from a slang term from the 1920s, meaning something exceptional or outstanding. And truly, the Bees Knees stands as a testament to how effective simple ingredients can be when put together thoughtfully.</p><h3 id=ingredients-1>Ingredients</h3><ul><li>2 oz Gin</li><li>3/4 oz fresh lemon juice</li><li>1/2 oz honey syrup (mix equal parts honey and hot water)</li></ul><h3 id=method-1>Method</h3><p>Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled coupe or martini glass. Garnish with a lemon twist or a sprig of rosemary.</p><h3 id=why-you-should-try-it-1>Why You Should Try It</h3><p>The Bees Knees is a cocktail that celebrates the floral and aromatic qualities of gin, paired with the natural sweetness of honey. The honey syrup brings an organic sweetness that’s balanced out by the tartness of lemon, creating a wonderfully smooth, easy-to-drink cocktail. It&rsquo;s a fantastic choice for those who prefer a gin cocktail that&rsquo;s not overly juniper-forward, but still retains the botanical essence of the spirit.</p><hr><h2 id=3-the-vesper-martini>3. The Vesper Martini</h2><h3 id=the-origins-2>The Origins</h3><p>The Vesper Martini gained fame thanks to Ian Fleming’s James Bond novel, <em>Casino Royale</em>. In the book, Bond orders a martini prepared with vodka, gin, and Kina Lillet (now replaced by Lillet Blanc due to the discontinuation of Kina Lillet). This drink was an unusual combination for its time, and while it has gained popularity due to the Bond franchise, it remains underrated when compared to other martinis.</p><h3 id=ingredients-2>Ingredients</h3><ul><li>3 oz Gin</li><li>1 oz Vodka</li><li>1/2 oz Lillet Blanc</li><li>Lemon peel for garnish</li></ul><h3 id=method-2>Method</h3><p>Stir all ingredients with ice in a mixing glass and strain into a chilled martini glass. Garnish with a lemon peel twist.</p><h3 id=why-you-should-try-it-2>Why You Should Try It</h3><p>The Vesper Martini is a unique twist on the traditional martini, offering a smoother, more approachable flavor profile thanks to the addition of vodka and Lillet Blanc. It&rsquo;s less dry than a typical martini, and the Lillet adds a hint of herbal and citrus complexity. The result is a drink that’s both refreshing and sophisticated, making it a fantastic choice for those looking for a martini with more depth.</p><hr><h2 id=4-the-pimms-cup>4. The Pimm’s Cup</h2><h3 id=the-origins-3>The Origins</h3><p>Invented in 1823 by James Pimm, a London restaurateur, the Pimm&rsquo;s Cup became a staple of British summer drinking culture. Its signature cocktail, the Pimm’s Cup, is often enjoyed at outdoor events like Wimbledon and other garden parties. Despite its history, this gin-based cocktail remains relatively underappreciated outside of the UK, making it a perfect candidate for your next warm-weather sip.</p><h3 id=ingredients-3>Ingredients</h3><ul><li>2 oz Pimm’s No. 1</li><li>3 oz lemon soda or ginger ale</li><li>Fresh cucumber, mint, strawberries, and orange slices for garnish</li></ul><h3 id=method-3>Method</h3><p>Fill a tall glass with ice. Add the Pimm’s No. 1, then top with your choice of lemon soda or ginger ale. Stir gently and garnish with fresh fruit and herbs.</p><h3 id=why-you-should-try-it-3>Why You Should Try It</h3><p>The Pimm’s Cup is incredibly refreshing and light, with a beautiful herbal flavor profile coming from the Pimm&rsquo;s No. 1 liqueur. The drink is customizable with various fruits and herbs, allowing it to be as simple or complex as you like. The balance of citrus and herbal notes, combined with the refreshing effervescence, makes the Pimm&rsquo;s Cup a great drink for sunny afternoons or backyard barbecues. Its versatility and easy-drinking nature make it an underrated classic that deserves more attention.</p><hr><h2 id=5-the-southside>5. The Southside</h2><h3 id=the-origins-4>The Origins</h3><p>The Southside has an intriguing history, with some sources suggesting it was a favorite of Chicago gangsters in the early 20th century. The drink itself is a refreshing combination of gin, mint, and lime, which is shaken and served over ice, making it an ideal drink for hot weather. While the Southside has a rich history, it has largely flown under the radar in terms of modern cocktail popularity.</p><h3 id=ingredients-4>Ingredients</h3><ul><li>2 oz Gin</li><li>3/4 oz fresh lime juice</li><li>3/4 oz simple syrup</li><li>8-10 fresh mint leaves</li></ul><h3 id=method-4>Method</h3><p>Muddle mint leaves in the bottom of a shaker. Add gin, lime juice, simple syrup, and ice. Shake vigorously and strain into a chilled coupe glass. Garnish with a mint sprig.</p><h3 id=why-you-should-try-it-4>Why You Should Try It</h3><p>The Southside is the perfect choice for those who enjoy a refreshing mint-forward cocktail. The herbal qualities of fresh mint, paired with the citrusy lime, create a bright, zesty flavor that&rsquo;s balanced by the botanicals in gin. It&rsquo;s a simple, yet sophisticated drink that&rsquo;s perfect for those looking for a lighter cocktail with a touch of elegance.</p><hr><h2 id=6-the-negroni-sbagliato>6. The Negroni Sbagliato</h2><h3 id=the-origins-5>The Origins</h3><p>The Negroni Sbagliato is a variation of the classic Negroni, and its creation was actually the result of a mistake. The story goes that a bartender in Milan accidentally swapped the gin for sparkling wine, and the result was the Negroni Sbagliato. While the Negroni is a beloved drink worldwide, the Sbagliato often remains in the shadow of its more well-known cousin.</p><h3 id=ingredients-5>Ingredients</h3><ul><li>1 oz Campari</li><li>1 oz Sweet vermouth</li><li>1 oz Prosecco or sparkling wine</li></ul><h3 id=method-5>Method</h3><p>Build the drink directly in a rocks glass filled with ice. Add Campari and sweet vermouth, then top with prosecco. Stir gently and garnish with an orange slice.</p><h3 id=why-you-should-try-it-5>Why You Should Try It</h3><p>The Negroni Sbagliato offers a lighter and more effervescent twist on the original Negroni. The substitution of sparkling wine for gin reduces the drink&rsquo;s alcohol intensity while still preserving the signature bitterness from the Campari. The result is a less boozy, more refreshing take on the classic, perfect for those who enjoy the flavors of a Negroni but are looking for a slightly lighter alternative.</p><hr><h2 id=7-the-sidecar>7. The Sidecar</h2><h3 id=the-origins-6>The Origins</h3><p>The Sidecar is a classic cocktail dating back to the early 1900s, and like many cocktails from this era, its true origin is steeped in mystery. Some claim it was invented in Paris, while others argue it was created in London or New York. Regardless of its birthplace, the Sidecar remains a timeless and sophisticated drink that has managed to fly under the radar compared to its contemporaries.</p><h3 id=ingredients-6>Ingredients</h3><ul><li>2 oz Cognac or Brandy</li><li>3/4 oz Cointreau or triple sec</li><li>1/2 oz fresh lemon juice</li></ul><h3 id=method-6>Method</h3><p>Shake all ingredients with ice and strain into a chilled coupe glass. Optionally, rim the glass with sugar. Garnish with a lemon twist.</p><h3 id=why-you-should-try-it-6>Why You Should Try It</h3><p>The Sidecar is a wonderful balance of sweet, sour, and strong. The smoothness of Cognac or Brandy is complemented by the bright citrus from fresh lemon juice and the orange sweetness from Cointreau. It&rsquo;s an elegant and sophisticated drink that doesn’t get the attention it deserves, making it the perfect choice for someone looking for a classic cocktail with refined flavors.</p><hr><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Cocktail culture is vast, and while there are certain drinks that will always hold a special place in our hearts, it’s essential to explore the many other underrated classics that deserve our attention.
