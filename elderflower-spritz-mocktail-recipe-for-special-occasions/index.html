With just a few simple ingredients, you’ll be able to create an impressive and refreshing mocktail for any occasion.</p><h3 id=how-to-make-elderflower-spritz-mocktail>How to Make Elderflower Spritz Mocktail</h3><p>Making this elderflower spritz mocktail is quick and easy, and the result is an elegant drink that will be the highlight of your event. Follow these simple steps to create this refreshing beverage:</p><h4 id=step-1-prepare-your-glass>Step 1: Prepare Your Glass</h4><p>Start by choosing a large wine glass or a highball glass for serving. The wide opening of these glasses will help accentuate the aromas of the elderflower and allow the bubbles from the sparkling water to shine. Add a handful of ice cubes to the glass to chill it properly.</p><h4 id=step-2-add-the-elderflower-cordial>Step 2: Add the Elderflower Cordial</h4><p>Next, pour 3 oz of elderflower cordial (or elderflower syrup, depending on what you have) into the glass. The elderflower cordial is the base flavor of your mocktail, offering a delicate sweetness with just the right amount of floral notes.</p><h4 id=step-3-squeeze-fresh-lemon-juice>Step 3: Squeeze Fresh Lemon Juice</h4><p>To balance the sweetness of the elderflower, add 2 oz of freshly squeezed lemon juice. This will introduce a zesty citrus note that brightens up the entire drink and adds a refreshing tartness. Fresh lemon juice is always better than bottled, as it has a fresher and more vibrant taste.</p><h4 id=step-4-add-sparkling-water>Step 4: Add Sparkling Water</h4><p>Once the elderflower cordial and lemon juice are combined, top the glass with 4 oz of sparkling water. You can use club soda for a neutral flavor or sparkling mineral water for a slight mineral taste. The sparkling bubbles give the mocktail a lively effervescence, making it perfect for toasting during special moments.</p><h4 id=step-5-stir-and-garnish>Step 5: Stir and Garnish</h4><p>Gently stir the mixture to combine all the ingredients. You don’t want to lose the fizz from the sparkling water, so a light stir is enough. Once combined, garnish with a sprig of fresh mint and a slice of lemon for a pop of color. If you&rsquo;re feeling extra fancy, add an edible flower like a pansy or a violeta to enhance the drink&rsquo;s visual appeal.</p><h4 id=step-6-serve-and-enjoy>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h4><p>Your elderflower spritz mocktail is ready to be served! Pour the drink into a beautiful glass, and serve it immediately for maximum refreshment. The mocktail is best enjoyed on a sunny day, but it&rsquo;s versatile enough to be served year-round.</p><h2 id=why-choose-a-mocktail-over-an-alcoholic-beverage>Why Choose a Mocktail Over an Alcoholic Beverage?</h2><p>There are many reasons why mocktails, like the elderflower spritz, are becoming a popular choice for special occasions.
