These ingredients are easy to find in most grocery stores and can be adjusted to your preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Flatbreads</strong> (store-bought or homemade): The foundation of your pizza. You can use any type of flatbread you prefer. Traditional pita bread works well, but any thin flatbread will do.</li><li><strong>Fresh spinach</strong>: Spinach adds a wonderful flavor and color to the pizza. You can also use frozen spinach, but make sure it is well-drained if you choose to go that route.</li><li><strong>Goat cheese</strong>: Creamy and tangy, goat cheese pairs perfectly with the spinach. It also melts beautifully, adding a smooth texture to the pizza.</li><li><strong>Olive oil</strong>: A drizzle of olive oil enhances the flavors and ensures the flatbread crisps up nicely.</li><li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Fresh garlic adds a punch of flavor. Garlic is a common ingredient in many pizza recipes, and its savory taste complements the spinach and goat cheese.</li><li><strong>Red onion</strong>: Thinly sliced red onion provides a sweet, mild flavor and a bit of crunch. You can substitute with other onions or skip this if you prefer a simpler taste.</li><li><strong>Parmesan cheese</strong>: A light sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese adds depth of flavor and a subtle salty bite.</li><li><strong>Balsamic vinegar</strong>: This will be drizzled over the finished pizza, adding a touch of sweetness and acidity to balance out the richness of the goat cheese.</li></ul><p>Optional toppings:</p><ul><li><strong>Pine nuts</strong>: Toasted pine nuts can be sprinkled on top for added crunch and a nutty flavor.</li><li><strong>Fresh herbs</strong>: Basil, thyme, or oregano can be sprinkled over the pizza before serving for a fresh herbaceous touch.</li><li><strong>Chili flakes</strong>: If you like a bit of heat, a sprinkle of red chili flakes can add the perfect amount of spice.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-make-easy-flatbread-pizza-with-spinach-and-goat-cheese>How to Make Easy Flatbread Pizza with Spinach and Goat Cheese</h2><p>Now that you have all the ingredients, let’s get started on making this mouthwatering flatbread pizza.</p><h3 id=step-1-prepare-your-ingredients>Step 1: Prepare Your Ingredients</h3><p>Start by preheating your oven to 400°F (200°C). This temperature ensures that the flatbread will crisp up nicely, while the toppings melt and blend together. While the oven is heating, prepare your ingredients.</p><ul><li><strong>Spinach</strong>: If you&rsquo;re using fresh spinach, wash and dry the leaves thoroughly. Then, roughly chop them into smaller pieces. You don’t need to cook the spinach before adding it to the pizza, as it will wilt and soften in the oven.</li><li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Peel and finely chop or mince the garlic. If you’re a fan of garlic, feel free to add more to suit your taste.</li><li><strong>Red onion</strong>: Slice the red onion as thinly as possible. Thin slices will cook faster and provide a more delicate flavor.</li><li><strong>Goat cheese</strong>: Crumble the goat cheese into small pieces. This ensures that every bite has a little bit of that creamy tangy goodness.</li><li><strong>Parmesan cheese</strong>: Grate the Parmesan cheese if you’re using a block of cheese. If you have pre-grated Parmesan, it’s ready to go.</li></ul><h3 id=step-2-assemble-the-flatbread-pizzas>Step 2: Assemble the Flatbread Pizzas</h3><p>Once your ingredients are prepared, it’s time to assemble your pizza. This part is easy and fun – you can get creative and adjust the toppings to your liking.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Prepare the Flatbreads</strong>: Lay your flatbreads on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. If you prefer, you can lightly brush the flatbreads with olive oil to help them crisp up. This is especially helpful if you&rsquo;re using a thinner, store-bought flatbread.</p></li><li><p><strong>Garlic and Spinach</strong>: Drizzle a small amount of olive oil over the flatbreads and spread the minced garlic evenly on top. Then, layer the spinach leaves over the garlic. Be generous with the spinach – it will shrink a little as it cooks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add the Goat Cheese</strong>: Sprinkle the crumbled goat cheese evenly over the spinach. Make sure to leave a little space between the pieces of cheese so they can melt and spread nicely across the flatbread.</p></li><li><p><strong>Top with Red Onion</strong>: Arrange the thinly sliced red onions on top of the goat cheese. The sweetness of the onions will provide a great contrast to the tangy goat cheese.</p></li><li><p><strong>Finish with Parmesan</strong>: Lightly sprinkle the grated Parmesan cheese over the entire pizza for an extra layer of flavor. Parmesan adds a salty and nutty element that enhances the overall taste of the pizza.</p></li></ol><h3 id=step-3-bake-the-flatbread-pizza>Step 3: Bake the Flatbread Pizza</h3><p>Place the assembled pizzas in the preheated oven and bake for about 10-12 minutes. The flatbread should turn golden brown and crisp up nicely around the edges, while the spinach wilts and the cheese melts to perfection.</p><p>Check the pizza after 8 minutes to ensure it’s cooking evenly. Depending on your oven, you may need to rotate the baking sheet to ensure even browning. The goal is to have a crispy crust with perfectly melted goat cheese and wilted spinach.</p><h3 id=step-4-finishing-touches>Step 4: Finishing Touches</h3><p>Once your flatbread pizza is out of the oven, it’s time to give it the finishing touch.</p><ul><li><strong>Balsamic Drizzle</strong>: Drizzle a small amount of balsamic vinegar over the pizza. This adds a lovely sweet and tangy note that balances out the richness of the goat cheese and complements the spinach.</li><li><strong>Optional Toppings</strong>: If you’re using pine nuts, herbs, or chili flakes, now is the time to sprinkle them on top of your pizza. Toasted pine nuts will add a delightful crunch, while fresh herbs will provide a burst of freshness. A pinch of chili flakes can offer a slight kick if you like a bit of heat in your dish.</li></ul><h3 id=step-5-slice-and-serve>Step 5: Slice and Serve</h3><p>Once the pizza has cooled for a minute or two, slice it into wedges or squares, depending on the size of the flatbread. Serve immediately, and enjoy your homemade, easy-to-make flatbread pizza with spinach and goat cheese!</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-perfect-flatbread-pizza>Tips for the Perfect Flatbread Pizza</h2><ul><li><strong>Choosing the Right Flatbread</strong>: For the best results, use a flatbread that is thick enough to hold the toppings but thin enough to get crispy. If your flatbread is too thick, it might not crisp up properly, while a too-thin flatbread could become soggy. Experiment with different types to find the one you like best.</li><li><strong>Toppings Variations</strong>: This recipe is highly adaptable. You can swap the spinach for arugula or kale for a different flavor profile. Add sun-dried tomatoes, olives, or artichoke hearts for extra Mediterranean flair.</li><li><strong>Add Protein</strong>: If you’re looking to make this pizza more filling, you can add grilled chicken, turkey, or even a fried egg on top after baking. These proteins pair nicely with the creamy goat cheese.</li><li><strong>Use a Pizza Stone</strong>: If you have a pizza stone, use it! Preheat the stone in the oven and then bake your flatbread pizza on it. This will help achieve an even crispier crust.</li></ul><h2 id=why-this-recipe-works>Why This Recipe Works</h2><p>This flatbread pizza is the perfect combination of simplicity and flavor.
