This will be the base of your soup&rsquo;s flavor.</li><li><strong>2 carrots</strong> – Peeled and chopped. Carrots add sweetness and color to the soup.</li><li><strong>2 celery stalks</strong> – Chopped. Celery brings a subtle savory crunch.</li><li><strong>2 cloves garlic</strong> – Minced. Garlic enhances the depth of flavor in the soup.</li><li><strong>1 ½ cups dried lentils</strong> – Rinsed and sorted. Lentils are the star of this dish, so make sure to rinse them before adding them to the soup.</li><li><strong>6 cups vegetable broth</strong> – You can use chicken broth if preferred, but vegetable broth keeps the soup plant-based.</li><li><strong>1 can diced tomatoes (14.5 oz)</strong> – Adds acidity and richness to balance the flavors.</li><li><strong>1 teaspoon ground cumin</strong> – This spice adds an earthy warmth to the soup.</li><li><strong>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</strong> – A touch of turmeric provides a subtle depth and vibrant color.</li><li><strong>1 teaspoon ground paprika</strong> – For a mild smokiness.</li><li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong> – To taste.</li><li><strong>2 cups spinach</strong> – Fresh spinach is optional, but it’s a great way to add some leafy greens to your meal.</li></ul><h3 id=optional-garnishes>Optional Garnishes:</h3><ul><li><strong>Fresh lemon juice</strong> – A squeeze of lemon adds a refreshing, bright flavor to balance the richness of the soup.</li><li><strong>Fresh herbs (parsley or cilantro)</strong> – These can add a fresh, herbal note to the finished dish.</li></ul><p>Now that you have your ingredients, let’s move on to the simple steps to make this easy lentil soup.</p><h2 id=step-by-step-instructions>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2><h3 id=1-prepare-the-ingredients>1. Prepare the Ingredients</h3><p>Before you begin cooking, it&rsquo;s important to prepare all the ingredients. Chop your onion, carrots, celery, and garlic. Rinse your lentils thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris. If you&rsquo;re using spinach, wash and chop it as well. Having everything ready to go will make the cooking process smoother and quicker.</p><h3 id=2-sauté-the-vegetables>2. Sauté the Vegetables</h3><p>In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté the vegetables for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they start to soften and the onion becomes translucent. This will form the flavor base of your soup.</p><p>Add the minced garlic to the pot and cook for another minute. Garlic can burn quickly, so be sure to stir it in right before it gets too brown. At this stage, your kitchen should start to smell wonderfully aromatic!</p><h3 id=3-add-spices-and-lentils>3. Add Spices and Lentils</h3><p>Now it’s time to add the spices. Sprinkle in the cumin, turmeric, and paprika, stirring well to coat the vegetables evenly. This step is essential to infuse the soup with deep, savory flavors. Let the spices cook for a minute or two to release their essential oils and bring out their full flavor.</p><p>Add the rinsed lentils to the pot and stir them in with the spiced vegetables. The lentils will absorb some of the flavors at this stage, which is exactly what you want.</p><h3 id=4-add-broth-and-tomatoes>4. Add Broth and Tomatoes</h3><p>Pour in the vegetable broth and diced tomatoes, including the juice. Stir everything to combine and bring the mixture to a boil. Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the soup simmer gently for about 25-30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender and have absorbed the flavors.</p><p>During the cooking process, feel free to check the soup occasionally. If you find that the soup is getting too thick, add a little more broth or water to reach your desired consistency.</p><h3 id=5-add-spinach-and-season>5. Add Spinach and Season</h3><p>Once the lentils are tender, add the spinach to the soup. Stir it in until the spinach wilts and softens, which should only take about 2-3 minutes. You can also add more seasoning at this point, depending on your taste. A pinch of salt and pepper should do the trick, but if you like more flavor, feel free to adjust the spices.</p><h3 id=6-simmer-and-serve>6. Simmer and Serve</h3><p>Let the soup simmer for an additional 5 minutes to ensure all the flavors are well blended. Then, taste the soup one last time and adjust the seasoning if needed.</p><p>Serve the soup hot with a garnish of fresh lemon juice for a zesty, bright finish. You can also sprinkle some fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro for an added layer of flavor and color.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-lentil-soup>Tips for Perfect Lentil Soup</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Choosing Lentils</strong>: You can use any type of lentil for this recipe, but green or brown lentils work best because they hold their shape well during cooking. Red lentils cook faster and tend to break down into a more mushy consistency, which can also be great for a smoother soup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Storage</strong>: Leftover lentil soup can be stored in the fridge for up to 4-5 days. It also freezes very well for up to 3 months, so you can make a big batch and enjoy it over multiple meals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customizing the Soup</strong>: One of the best things about lentil soup is how customizable it is. Feel free to add other vegetables like zucchini, potatoes, or bell peppers. You can also experiment with different spices like cinnamon or coriander for a unique twist.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thickening the Soup</strong>: If you prefer a thicker soup, you can puree a portion of the soup in a blender or use an immersion blender directly in the pot. This will create a creamy texture without having to add any cream or dairy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Protein Boost</strong>: If you&rsquo;re looking to make this soup even more protein-packed, consider adding some cooked quinoa or chickpeas along with the lentils for extra texture and nutrition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spice Levels</strong>: Adjust the amount of spices based on your personal preference. If you enjoy a spicier soup, consider adding a pinch of cayenne pepper or a small diced chili for some heat.</p></li></ul><h2 id=health-benefits-of-lentils>Health Benefits of Lentils</h2><p>Lentils aren’t just tasty; they’re also incredibly good for you.
