Garnishing food in a fun and creative way can make mealtime a delight for children, encouraging them to try new foods and enjoy the experience of eating together as a family. In this post, we'll explore some fun and easy garnishing ideas that are perfect for kids, and provide tips on how to make mealtime more enjoyable for the whole family.
Why Garnish for Kids?
Garnishing food is not just for presentation; it's also a way to make meals more appealing and exciting to eat. For kids, food can be a source of fascination, and garnishing allows them to connect with their food in a fun and interactive way. By making mealtime more enjoyable, we can also encourage kids to develop healthy eating habits and a positive relationship with food.
Fun Ideas for Garnishing for Kids
Edible Flowers
Edible flowers are a great way to add a pop of color and flavor to any dish. For kids, they're like a special surprise on their plate. Try adding edible flowers like pansies, violas, or nasturtiums to salads, pasta dishes, or even pizzas. Not only do they look pretty, but they also add a delicate flavor and fragrance to the food.
Creative Uses for Fresh Herbs
Fresh herbs like basil, rosemary, and thyme can be used as garnishes in a variety of ways. Try using them to create fun shapes and designs on the plate, or as a sprinkle on top of a dish. Kids love getting involved and using herbs to create a beautiful garnish.
Cheese and Meat Picks
Meat and cheese picks are a fun and easy way to add a pop of color and flavor to a dish. Try using cheese picks with grapes and fruit to create a colorful skewer, or meat picks with cheese and crackers for a quick snack.
Fancy Fruit
