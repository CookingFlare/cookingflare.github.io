To do this, start by combining the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Cut in the dairy-free butter using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. The butter should be cold to ensure the crust stays flaky.</p><p>Next, add in the cold water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix it into the dough until it just comes together. If the dough feels too dry, you can add a little more water, but be cautious not to make it too wet. Once the dough forms into a ball, cover it with plastic wrap and refrigerate it for about 30 minutes. This will make it easier to roll out and prevent it from shrinking while baking.</p><h3 id=step-2-cook-the-beef-and-onions>Step 2: Cook the Beef and Onions</h3><p>While the dough is chilling, it’s time to prepare the filling. In a large skillet, heat a bit of oil over medium heat and add the diced onions. Sauté the onions until they become soft and translucent, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.</p><p>Add the ground beef (or plant-based alternative) to the skillet and cook it until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. Once the meat is fully cooked, drain any excess fat, if needed, and add the tomato paste, Dijon mustard, and ketchup. Stir everything together until well combined.</p><p>Season the mixture with salt, pepper, smoked paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder. Adjust the seasoning to your taste, and let it simmer for 5-10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Once done, remove the pan from heat and stir in the dairy-free cheese. The cheese will melt into the mixture, creating a creamy and cheesy filling.</p><p>For an added touch of authenticity, you can mix in some chopped pickles into the filling, which will give your cheeseburger pie that iconic tangy flavor you find in a regular cheeseburger.</p><h3 id=step-3-roll-out-the-pie-dough>Step 3: Roll Out the Pie Dough</h3><p>While the filling is cooling, roll out the chilled pie dough on a lightly floured surface. You’ll want to roll it out to fit your pie dish or baking pan. Gently transfer the dough to the pie dish, ensuring it covers the bottom and sides completely. Trim any excess dough around the edges, and use a fork to lightly prick the bottom of the dough. This will help prevent the crust from puffing up as it bakes.</p><h3 id=step-4-assemble-the-cheeseburger-pie>Step 4: Assemble the Cheeseburger Pie</h3><p>Now that your crust and filling are ready, it’s time to assemble the pie. Spoon the cheeseburger filling into the prepared pie crust, spreading it out evenly. If you’d like a cheesier topping, sprinkle a little more dairy-free cheese on top of the filling before baking.</p><h3 id=step-5-bake-the-pie>Step 5: Bake the Pie</h3><p>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the pie in the oven and bake for 30-35 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. If you find that the crust is browning too quickly, you can cover the edges with aluminum foil to prevent burning.</p><p>Once the pie is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool for about 5-10 minutes before serving. This allows the filling to set slightly and makes it easier to slice.</p><h3 id=step-6-serve-and-enjoy>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Once the pie has cooled, slice it into wedges and serve! You can garnish with fresh parsley or add a few extra pickle slices on top for that authentic cheeseburger feel. For a complete meal, serve it with a side salad, crispy fries, or steamed veggies.</p><h2 id=tips-for-a-perfect-dairy-free-cheeseburger-pie>Tips for a Perfect Dairy-Free Cheeseburger Pie</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Customize Your Filling</strong>: Feel free to get creative with the filling!
