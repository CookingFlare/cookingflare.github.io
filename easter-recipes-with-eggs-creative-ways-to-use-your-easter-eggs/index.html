Start by chopping your hard-boiled eggs and mixing them with mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, and a dash of salt and pepper. You can also add a bit of crunch with finely chopped celery or pickles.</p><p>For a gourmet twist, consider adding fresh herbs like dill or tarragon, or even a handful of arugula for a peppery bite. Spread the egg salad generously between slices of toasted bread, or use a buttery croissant for a more indulgent touch. Egg salad sandwiches are perfect for a light lunch or picnic and are a great way to repurpose your Easter eggs.</p><p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Add a layer of crispy bacon or a slice of cheese to elevate your egg salad sandwich further.</p><h2 id=3-spring-vegetable-and-egg-frittata>3. Spring Vegetable and Egg Frittata</h2><p>A frittata is a versatile and delicious way to incorporate Easter eggs into a savory dish. Perfect for breakfast or brunch, a frittata allows you to showcase the seasonal flavors of spring while using your leftover eggs.
