The result is a rich, buttery dessert that is both crunchy and sticky, with a perfect balance of sweetness and nuttiness.</p><h3 id=how-to-make-baklava>How to Make Baklava</h3><p>To make baklava, you will need:</p><ul><li>Filo dough</li><li>Unsalted butter, melted</li><li>Mixed nuts (pistachios, walnuts, or hazelnuts)</li><li>Sugar</li><li>Water</li><li>Lemon juice</li><li>Rose or orange blossom water (optional)</li></ul><p>Start by layering the filo dough sheets, brushing each layer with melted butter. After layering several sheets, sprinkle a thin layer of chopped nuts. Repeat the layering process until all the dough and nuts are used up.
