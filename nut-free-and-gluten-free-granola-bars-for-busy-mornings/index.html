With just a few simple ingredients, you can prepare a batch of granola bars that will last you for the week. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to create your own nut-free and gluten-free granola bars.</p><h3 id=ingredients>Ingredients</h3><ul><li>2 cups gluten-free rolled oats</li><li>1 cup puffed rice (ensure it’s gluten-free)</li><li>1/2 cup sunflower seeds (or any other seed you prefer)</li><li>1/2 cup dried cranberries (or any dried fruit of your choice)</li><li>1/4 cup chia seeds or flaxseeds (optional, for added omega-3s)</li><li>1/4 cup maple syrup (or honey, depending on your preference)</li><li>1/4 cup coconut oil (melted)</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon (optional)</li><li>1/4 cup coconut flakes (optional for added texture)</li></ul><h3 id=directions>Directions</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong>
Begin by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking dish (preferably an 8x8-inch dish) with parchment paper for easy removal later on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prepare the Dry Ingredients:</strong>
In a large bowl, combine the gluten-free rolled oats, puffed rice, sunflower seeds, dried cranberries, and chia or flaxseeds. If you like coconut, you can add in the coconut flakes at this stage as well. Stir everything together until evenly mixed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mix the Wet Ingredients:</strong>
In a separate, smaller bowl, whisk together the melted coconut oil, maple syrup, vanilla extract, salt, and cinnamon (if using). These wet ingredients will help bind your granola bars together and add a sweet, aromatic flavor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Combine the Wet and Dry Ingredients:</strong>
Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until everything is well coated and evenly combined. The mixture should be sticky but manageable. If it feels too dry, add a little more maple syrup or coconut oil to adjust the texture.</p></li><li><p><strong>Press the Mixture into the Baking Dish:</strong>
Transfer the granola mixture into the prepared baking dish. Use a spatula or the back of a spoon to press the mixture down firmly. Make sure it’s evenly distributed and compacted, as this will help the bars hold their shape when cut.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bake:</strong>
Bake the granola mixture in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the bars have set. Keep an eye on them towards the end to ensure they don&rsquo;t over-bake.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cool and Cut:</strong>
Once baked, remove the granola bars from the oven and allow them to cool completely in the pan. This step is crucial for the bars to firm up properly. Once cooled, use a sharp knife to cut them into squares or rectangles, depending on your preference.</p></li><li><p><strong>Storage:</strong>
Store the bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. Alternatively, you can refrigerate them for a longer shelf life. These bars also freeze well if you want to make a larger batch and store them for future use.</p></li></ol><h2 id=customizing-your-granola-bars>Customizing Your Granola Bars</h2><p>One of the best things about making your own granola bars is how easy it is to tailor them to your preferences. You can adjust the ingredients based on your taste and dietary needs. Here are some ways you can modify this recipe:</p><h3 id=1-add-more-dried-fruits>1. <strong>Add More Dried Fruits:</strong></h3><p>Dried fruits like apricots, raisins, or blueberries can add natural sweetness and extra fiber to your granola bars. Feel free to mix and match different fruits to find your favorite combination.</p><h3 id=2-experiment-with-seeds>2. <strong>Experiment with Seeds:</strong></h3><p>While sunflower seeds are a great option, you can also use other seeds like pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, or sesame seeds. These seeds will add a nice crunch to your granola bars and boost their nutritional profile.</p><h3 id=3-incorporate-spices>3. <strong>Incorporate Spices:</strong></h3><p>Adding spices like ground ginger, nutmeg, or even cocoa powder can give your granola bars a warm, comforting flavor. Cinnamon is the most common choice, but don&rsquo;t be afraid to get creative and experiment with other spices that you enjoy.</p><h3 id=4-use-different-sweeteners>4. <strong>Use Different Sweeteners:</strong></h3><p>If you prefer a different sweetener than maple syrup, you can use honey, agave nectar, or brown rice syrup. Just keep in mind that each sweetener will contribute a slightly different taste and texture.</p><h3 id=5-add-chocolate-chips>5. <strong>Add Chocolate Chips:</strong></h3><p>If you&rsquo;re in the mood for something a little indulgent, try adding some dairy-free chocolate chips or cocoa nibs to your granola bars. This addition will give them a touch of sweetness and a satisfying chocolatey flavor without the added dairy or gluten.</p><h3 id=6-add-protein>6. <strong>Add Protein:</strong></h3><p>For a protein boost, consider adding a scoop of your favorite protein powder or even some hemp hearts to the mixture. This is particularly useful if you&rsquo;re using the bars as a post-workout snack.</p><h2 id=why-these-granola-bars-are-perfect-for-busy-mornings>Why These Granola Bars are Perfect for Busy Mornings</h2><p>When it comes to busy mornings, it can be difficult to find time to prepare a nutritious breakfast.
