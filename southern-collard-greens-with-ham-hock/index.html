This dish, typically cooked with smoked ham hock, has been a beloved part of Southern tables for generations. In this recipe, we’ll walk you through making Southern collard greens with ham hock, a flavorful and hearty side dish that’s perfect for any occasion, whether you’re celebrating a holiday, preparing a Sunday dinner, or just craving some soul-satisfying comfort food.</p><h2 id=what-are-collard-greens>What Are Collard Greens?</h2><p>Collard greens are a type of leafy green vegetable in the Brassica family, which also includes kale, cabbage, and mustard greens. They have large, dark green leaves that have a slightly bitter taste, which softens when cooked. The greens are packed with vitamins, minerals, and fiber, making them a nutritious addition to any meal. Collard greens are typically cooked for long periods, which allows their flavor to meld with the seasonings and the meat used in the dish.</p><p>In Southern cooking, collard greens are often paired with ham hock for added flavor. The ham hock, which is the lower portion of a pig&rsquo;s leg, is typically slow-cooked, allowing its fat and smoky flavors to infuse the greens. This creates a rich, savory dish that pairs wonderfully with cornbread, fried chicken, or any other classic Southern fare.</p><h2 id=ingredients-for-southern-collard-greens-with-ham-hock>Ingredients for Southern Collard Greens with Ham Hock</h2><p>Before we dive into the cooking process, let’s gather all the ingredients you’ll need. This recipe is designed to serve about 6 to 8 people, making it perfect for family gatherings or meal prep for the week ahead.</p><h3 id=ingredients>Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>2 lbs fresh collard greens</li><li>1 ham hock (smoked)</li><li>1 large onion, chopped</li><li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li><li>1 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li><li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li><li>2 teaspoons sugar</li><li>6 cups chicken broth (or enough to cover the greens)</li><li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li><li>Salt and pepper to taste</li><li>1 tablespoon of hot sauce (optional)</li><li>1 bay leaf</li><li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li><li>1 tablespoon butter (optional, for extra richness)</li></ul><p>Now that we have everything ready, let’s get started with cooking!</p><h2 id=step-by-step-guide-to-making-southern-collard-greens-with-ham-hock>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Southern Collard Greens with Ham Hock</h2><h3 id=1-prepare-the-collard-greens>1. Prepare the Collard Greens</h3><p>Start by thoroughly washing the collard greens. These greens grow close to the ground, so they can often have dirt and grit on their leaves. To clean them, fill a large bowl or basin with cold water, and submerge the leaves. Swish the greens around to loosen any dirt, then drain the water and repeat until the water runs clear.</p><p>Once the collard greens are clean, remove the thick stems. You can do this by folding the leaves in half along the stem and slicing it out, or you can tear the leaves off the stem by hand. After removing the stems, chop the collard greens into large strips or bite-sized pieces, depending on your preference.</p><h3 id=2-brown-the-ham-hock>2. Brown the Ham Hock</h3><p>Next, take your smoked ham hock and brown it in a large pot or Dutch oven. Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat and place the ham hock in the pot. Sear it on all sides until it has a nice golden brown color. This will help develop deeper flavors for the greens as they cook.</p><p>Once the ham hock is browned, remove it from the pot and set it aside.</p><h3 id=3-sauté-the-aromatics>3. Sauté the Aromatics</h3><p>In the same pot, add the chopped onions and garlic. Sauté them in the rendered fat from the ham hock until the onions become translucent, about 5 minutes. The aromatic smell will start to fill your kitchen, signaling that the base of your dish is coming together perfectly.</p><p>At this stage, you can add the red pepper flakes and smoked paprika. The red pepper flakes will add a subtle heat, while the smoked paprika enhances the earthy, smoky flavors of the ham hock. Stir the mixture and cook for another minute to toast the spices slightly.</p><h3 id=4-add-the-greens-and-liquids>4. Add the Greens and Liquids</h3><p>Now it’s time to add the collard greens to the pot. Since collard greens can be quite voluminous, you may need to add them in batches. Add a handful at a time, stirring it around to wilt the greens down as they cook. Once all the greens are added, pour in the chicken broth. The broth should cover the greens, but you can always add a little extra if needed.</p><p>Add the sugar, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and bay leaf to the pot. The sugar will balance the bitterness of the collard greens, while the apple cider vinegar provides a touch of acidity that helps to bring the flavors together.</p><h3 id=5-simmer-and-cook-low-and-slow>5. Simmer and Cook Low and Slow</h3><p>Now that everything is in the pot, return the ham hock to the mixture. Stir everything together, and then bring the pot to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let it simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the collard greens are tender and the flavors have melded together.</p><p>During this time, the ham hock will release its savory juices into the greens, infusing them with rich flavor. You’ll know the greens are done when they are soft, and the broth has thickened slightly. Stir occasionally to make sure the greens don’t stick to the bottom of the pot.</p><h3 id=6-final-seasoning-adjustments>6. Final Seasoning Adjustments</h3><p>Once the collard greens are cooked to your desired tenderness, remove the ham hock from the pot. Shred the meat off the bone, discarding any fat, cartilage, or skin. Return the shredded ham hock meat to the pot and stir everything together. Taste the dish and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, and hot sauce if you prefer a little extra heat. You can also add a tablespoon of butter to give the greens a velvety richness.</p><h3 id=7-serve-and-enjoy>7. Serve and Enjoy!</h3><p>Your Southern collard greens with ham hock are now ready to be served! These greens are best enjoyed with a side of cornbread, fried chicken, or any of your favorite Southern dishes. The rich, smoky flavor of the ham hock complements the collard greens perfectly, creating a dish that’s both hearty and full of comforting flavors.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-collard-greens-every-time>Tips for Perfect Collard Greens Every Time</h2><ul><li><strong>Freshness Matters</strong>: For the best flavor, use fresh collard greens. If you have to use frozen greens, be sure to thaw and drain them thoroughly before cooking.</li><li><strong>Smoked Meat</strong>: If you don’t have a ham hock, you can substitute with other smoked meats like smoked turkey wings or bacon for a slightly different flavor profile.</li><li><strong>Add a Kick</strong>: If you like your greens spicy, feel free to increase the amount of red pepper flakes or add a splash of hot sauce while cooking.</li><li><strong>Longer Cooking</strong>: Collard greens only get better with time. If you can, let the greens simmer for even longer, or make them a day ahead for a richer flavor.</li><li><strong>Leftovers</strong>: Collard greens make for fantastic leftovers. They actually taste better the next day, after all the flavors have had time to marinate. Just reheat on the stovetop with a splash of broth if they get too thick.</li></ul><h2 id=why-collard-greens-are-a-southern-tradition>Why Collard Greens are a Southern Tradition</h2><p>Collard greens with ham hock are a symbol of Southern hospitality and tradition.
