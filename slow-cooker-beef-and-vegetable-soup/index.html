They’re perfect for making dishes like this beef and vegetable soup, where the ingredients need to cook slowly to develop deep, rich flavors. The low-and-slow method of cooking in a slow cooker breaks down tough cuts of meat, making them incredibly tender, while allowing the vegetables to absorb all the savory goodness from the broth.</p><p>The beauty of this beef and vegetable soup is its versatility. You can swap out vegetables based on what you have on hand or your personal preferences. The result is always a flavorful, nourishing dish that satisfies your hunger and keeps you coming back for more.</p><h2 id=ingredients-youll-need>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2><h3 id=for-the-soup>For the Soup:</h3><ul><li><strong>Beef stew meat</strong>: 1.5 to 2 pounds of beef stew meat, such as chuck roast, cut into 1-inch cubes. This cut of meat works wonderfully in a slow cooker because it becomes tender and flavorful after slow cooking.</li><li><strong>Potatoes</strong>: 2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced. They add substance to the soup and soak up the delicious broth.</li><li><strong>Carrots</strong>: 3 medium carrots, peeled and sliced. Carrots add sweetness and color to the soup.</li><li><strong>Celery</strong>: 2 celery stalks, chopped. Celery adds crunch and a subtle flavor.</li><li><strong>Onion</strong>: 1 medium onion, chopped. Onions are key for building flavor at the base of any good soup.</li><li><strong>Garlic</strong>: 4 cloves garlic, minced. Fresh garlic adds a depth of flavor that elevates the whole dish.</li><li><strong>Green beans</strong>: 1 cup, cut into 1-inch pieces. Green beans bring some freshness and texture to the soup.</li><li><strong>Tomatoes</strong>: 1 can (14.5 ounces) diced tomatoes, undrained. Tomatoes add a rich acidity and slight sweetness to balance the beef.</li><li><strong>Beef broth</strong>: 4 cups. Beef broth serves as the foundation for the soup, adding savory depth.</li><li><strong>Frozen peas</strong>: 1 cup. Peas offer a burst of sweetness and color.</li><li><strong>Bay leaves</strong>: 2 bay leaves. These aromatic leaves add a mild herbal note that infuses the broth.</li><li><strong>Dried thyme</strong>: 1 teaspoon. Thyme complements the beef and vegetables, providing a savory, earthy flavor.</li><li><strong>Dried rosemary</strong>: 1/2 teaspoon. Rosemary adds a fragrant, piney note that pairs well with the beef.</li><li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong>: To taste. These basic seasonings bring all the flavors together.</li><li><strong>Olive oil</strong>: 1 tablespoon. This is used to brown the beef before adding it to the slow cooker.</li></ul><h3 id=optional-garnishes>Optional Garnishes:</h3><ul><li><strong>Chopped parsley</strong>: For a fresh, vibrant garnish that adds a burst of color and a hint of freshness.</li><li><strong>Grated Parmesan cheese</strong>: For a rich, umami finish.</li></ul><p>Feel free to adjust the vegetables and seasonings to suit your taste or dietary needs. The beauty of a slow-cooked soup is that it’s incredibly adaptable to different ingredients!</p><h2 id=instructions>Instructions</h2><h3 id=step-1-brown-the-beef-optional-but-recommended>Step 1: Brown the Beef (Optional, but Recommended)</h3><p>While this step is optional, it’s highly recommended as it adds a layer of flavor to the soup. Start by heating a large skillet over medium-high heat and adding the olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the beef stew meat in batches (do not overcrowd the pan) and brown it on all sides. This will take about 5-7 minutes. Browning the beef caramelizes the natural sugars in the meat, creating a rich, savory flavor that enhances the soup.</p><p>Once the beef is browned, transfer it to your slow cooker. If you want to skip this step, you can add the raw beef directly to the slow cooker, but keep in mind the flavor won’t be as rich.</p><h3 id=step-2-add-the-vegetables-and-broth>Step 2: Add the Vegetables and Broth</h3><p>Next, add the potatoes, carrots, celery, onion, garlic, and green beans to the slow cooker along with the browned beef. Add the diced tomatoes (with their juice) to the pot as well. Pour in the beef broth, making sure all the ingredients are submerged in the liquid. Add the bay leaves, thyme, and rosemary, and season the soup generously with salt and pepper to taste. Stir everything to combine, ensuring that all the ingredients are evenly distributed.</p><h3 id=step-3-set-and-forget>Step 3: Set and Forget</h3><p>Now comes the magic of slow cooking. Cover the slow cooker with the lid, set it to low, and let it cook for 7-8 hours, or until the beef is tender and the vegetables are cooked through. If you’re in a rush, you can set the slow cooker to high and cook the soup for 4-5 hours, though the flavors may not develop as fully.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-the-peas-and-adjust-seasoning>Step 4: Add the Peas and Adjust Seasoning</h3><p>About 30 minutes before the soup is done, add the frozen peas to the slow cooker. They don’t need as much cooking time as the other vegetables, and adding them later helps preserve their color and flavor. Taste the soup before serving, and adjust the seasoning if needed by adding more salt, pepper, or herbs.</p><h3 id=step-5-serve-and-enjoy>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy!</h3><p>Once the beef is fork-tender and the vegetables are cooked to perfection, your slow cooker beef and vegetable soup is ready to serve. Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with freshly chopped parsley or a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese for an extra touch of flavor. Pair it with a slice of crusty bread for dipping, and you’ve got a comforting meal that’s perfect for any occasion.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-best-slow-cooker-beef-and-vegetable-soup>Tips for the Best Slow Cooker Beef and Vegetable Soup</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Use a good cut of beef</strong>: The key to tender beef in a slow cooker soup is using a cut that benefits from long, slow cooking. Beef stew meat, chuck roast, or round are great options. They become incredibly tender and flavorful when cooked for hours in the slow cooker.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t skip the browning step</strong>: Although it takes a few extra minutes, browning the beef enhances the flavor of the soup. The caramelization process creates a deep, rich flavor that infuses the broth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adjust the veggies</strong>: Feel free to add or swap out vegetables based on what you have on hand. Zucchini, corn, parsnips, or even squash can all work well in this soup. Just make sure that the vegetables are cut to similar sizes for even cooking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add more liquid if needed</strong>: Depending on how thick you like your soup, you can always add extra beef broth or water. If the soup becomes too thick as it cooks, simply add more liquid to reach your desired consistency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it spicy</strong>: For those who love a little heat, consider adding a pinch of red pepper flakes, a chopped jalapeño, or a dash of hot sauce to the soup for a spicy kick.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it ahead</strong>: This soup can be made in advance and stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. It also freezes well for up to 3 months. Simply store it in an airtight container and reheat it when ready to enjoy.</p></li></ul><h2 id=why-youll-love-this-soup>Why You’ll Love This Soup</h2><h3 id=nutritious-and-filling>Nutritious and Filling</h3><p>This beef and vegetable soup is packed with wholesome ingredients like tender beef, potatoes, carrots, celery, and peas, making it a well-rounded meal that offers a variety of vitamins and nutrients.
