Vacuum-sealed bags are also a great option for long-term storage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Label Your Meals</strong>: Label each container or bag with the name of the dish and the date it was prepared. This will help you keep track of your meals and ensure they’re used within the appropriate time frame.</p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid Freezing Certain Ingredients</strong>: Some ingredients don’t freeze well, such as certain dairy products (like sour cream), crispy foods, or vegetables with high water content (like lettuce or cucumbers). Always check whether the ingredients in your recipe are freezer-friendly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reheat Properly</strong>: To maintain the best flavor and texture, always thaw freezer meals in the refrigerator overnight before reheating.
