Let&rsquo;s dive into how to make this smoky ham and bean soup and how to incorporate it into your weekly meal prep routine.</p><h2 id=why-smoky-ham-and-bean-soup>Why Smoky Ham and Bean Soup?</h2><p>The combination of smoky ham, tender beans, and a well-seasoned broth creates a deeply satisfying and nutrient-dense soup. Not only is this dish a great way to use up leftover ham, but it&rsquo;s also packed with fiber and protein, making it filling and nourishing. Additionally, the smoky flavor from the ham adds depth and complexity, while the beans contribute a creamy texture that makes each spoonful comforting.</p><p>Meal prepping this soup ensures you have a healthy and hearty meal ready for busy days when cooking seems like too much effort. The soup can be stored in the fridge for up to five days or frozen for longer storage, making it an excellent choice for those who want to plan ahead.</p><h3 id=ingredients>Ingredients</h3><p>To make smoky ham and bean soup, you&rsquo;ll need the following ingredients. This recipe is designed to serve about 6-8 people, and it can easily be doubled or halved depending on your needs.</p><ul><li><strong>2 tablespoons olive oil</strong></li><li><strong>1 medium onion</strong>, diced</li><li><strong>2 cloves garlic</strong>, minced</li><li><strong>2 large carrots</strong>, peeled and diced</li><li><strong>2 celery stalks</strong>, diced</li><li><strong>1 pound dried white beans</strong> (such as great northern or navy beans), soaked overnight and drained, or use 3 cans of white beans, drained and rinsed</li><li><strong>2 cups cooked ham</strong>, diced (preferably with a smoky flavor, such as leftover ham from a holiday roast)</li><li><strong>6 cups low-sodium chicken broth</strong></li><li><strong>2 cups water</strong></li><li><strong>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</strong> (for that signature smoky flavor)</li><li><strong>1 teaspoon dried thyme</strong></li><li><strong>1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary</strong></li><li><strong>1 bay leaf</strong></li><li><strong>Salt and black pepper</strong>, to taste</li><li><strong>1 tablespoon lemon juice</strong> (optional, for a touch of acidity)</li></ul><h3 id=instructions>Instructions</h3><h4 id=step-1-prepare-the-ingredients>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h4><p>Start by prepping your vegetables and ham. If you’re using dried beans, make sure to soak them overnight, or if you’re short on time, use the quick-soak method by bringing them to a boil for 2 minutes, then letting them sit, covered, for 1 hour before draining.</p><p>Dice your onion, carrots, and celery. Mince the garlic and cut the cooked ham into bite-sized cubes. If you’re using canned beans, drain and rinse them before adding them to the soup later.</p><h4 id=step-2-sauté-the-vegetables>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h4><p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the diced onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté the vegetables for about 5-7 minutes, or until the onion becomes translucent and the vegetables begin to soften. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute, stirring frequently, until the garlic becomes fragrant.</p><h4 id=step-3-add-the-ham-and-seasonings>Step 3: Add the Ham and Seasonings</h4><p>Next, add the diced ham to the pot. The ham will add a lot of flavor and depth to the soup, especially if it&rsquo;s smoked. Stir the ham into the vegetables and cook for about 3-4 minutes, allowing the ham to release its smoky aroma and start to brown slightly.</p><p>Now, add the smoked paprika, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf to the pot. Stir everything together, letting the spices toast for a minute or two to release their oils and bring out their flavors.</p><h4 id=step-4-add-the-beans-and-liquid>Step 4: Add the Beans and Liquid</h4><p>Once the vegetables are softened and the ham is well combined with the seasonings, it’s time to add the beans and liquid. If you’re using soaked dried beans, add them to the pot along with the chicken broth and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and let the soup simmer for 45-60 minutes, or until the beans are tender.</p><p>If you’re using canned beans, add them after the soup has simmered for 20-30 minutes, just to heat through. Simmering the soup for a longer time allows the flavors to meld together and the beans to absorb the smoky essence of the ham.</p><h4 id=step-5-final-touches>Step 5: Final Touches</h4><p>Once the soup is finished cooking, remove the bay leaf and taste the soup. Season with salt and black pepper as needed, and for a touch of brightness, add a tablespoon of lemon juice. This step is optional but helps balance the richness of the soup and enhances the overall flavor.</p><h4 id=step-6-serve-and-enjoy>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h4><p>Ladle the soup into bowls and serve it hot. This smoky ham and bean soup is perfect on its own, but you can serve it with crusty bread or a side salad for a complete meal. The hearty, smoky, and savory flavors are sure to satisfy your taste buds.</p><h3 id=how-to-make-this-soup-for-meal-prep>How to Make This Soup for Meal Prep</h3><p>Meal prepping this soup is straightforward, and it can save you time during the week when you need a healthy, comforting meal on the go.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Make a Double Batch</strong>: This recipe is easy to double, which will provide enough soup for multiple servings.
