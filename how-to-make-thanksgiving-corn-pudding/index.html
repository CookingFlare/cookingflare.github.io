It brings families and friends together, creating lasting memories around a table filled with delicious food. While turkey and stuffing often take the spotlight, there are a few side dishes that truly shine. One such dish is <strong>corn pudding</strong>, a creamy, comforting casserole that combines sweet corn with a rich, custard-like base. This dish adds a warm, hearty element to the table and pairs wonderfully with other traditional Thanksgiving sides.</p><p>In this post, we&rsquo;ll explore how to make a perfect Thanksgiving corn pudding, offering tips and tricks to help you create the most flavorful and smooth corn pudding your guests will rave about. Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned cook or a Thanksgiving novice, this recipe will ensure your corn pudding is a highlight of the holiday feast.</p><h2 id=what-is-corn-pudding>What Is Corn Pudding?</h2><p>Corn pudding is a popular side dish made primarily from corn, eggs, milk, and butter. It’s often described as a cross between cornbread and a creamy casserole, with a soft, smooth texture and a subtly sweet flavor. The dish is traditionally baked in the oven, which allows the ingredients to meld together and form a custard-like consistency that is both comforting and delicious.</p><p>Though it may not get the same recognition as mashed potatoes or green bean casserole, corn pudding is an easy and satisfying addition to your Thanksgiving spread. The natural sweetness of the corn, combined with the richness of the custard, creates a perfect balance of flavors. Plus, it&rsquo;s an ideal side dish for any Thanksgiving dinner, complementing both savory and sweet flavors.</p><h2 id=ingredients-for-thanksgiving-corn-pudding>Ingredients for Thanksgiving Corn Pudding</h2><p>To make the perfect corn pudding, you’ll need the following ingredients:</p><h3 id=ingredients>Ingredients:</h3><ul><li><strong>2 cups of whole kernel corn</strong> (fresh or frozen)</li><li><strong>1 cup of creamed corn</strong></li><li><strong>3 large eggs</strong></li><li><strong>1 cup of heavy cream</strong></li><li><strong>1/2 cup of whole milk</strong></li><li><strong>1/4 cup of unsalted butter</strong> (melted)</li><li><strong>1/2 teaspoon of salt</strong></li><li><strong>1/4 teaspoon of black pepper</strong></li><li><strong>1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder</strong></li><li><strong>1/4 teaspoon of onion powder</strong></li><li><strong>1/2 cup of cornbread mix</strong> (or 1/2 cup of cornmeal if you prefer a more rustic texture)</li><li><strong>1/4 teaspoon of baking powder</strong> (optional, for extra fluffiness)</li></ul><p>These ingredients come together to create a velvety, flavorful pudding with the perfect balance of corn and custard. You can also adjust the spices according to your preference, but the combination of garlic and onion powder adds a subtle depth of flavor that enhances the corn&rsquo;s natural sweetness.</p><h2 id=how-to-make-thanksgiving-corn-pudding>How to Make Thanksgiving Corn Pudding</h2><p>Making corn pudding is a straightforward process that doesn’t require advanced cooking skills. It’s a dish that anyone can prepare, even if you’re new to cooking Thanksgiving meals. Below are step-by-step instructions to make a mouthwatering corn pudding that your guests will love.</p><h3 id=step-1-preheat-the-oven>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h3><p>Begin by preheating your oven to <strong>350°F (175°C)</strong>. This is the ideal temperature for baking the corn pudding, allowing it to cook evenly and develop that perfect custard-like texture.</p><h3 id=step-2-prepare-the-baking-dish>Step 2: Prepare the Baking Dish</h3><p>Lightly grease a <strong>9x13-inch baking dish</strong> with cooking spray or butter. The non-stick surface will ensure the pudding comes out of the dish easily after baking. You can also opt for a smaller or larger dish depending on the number of servings you need. For a more decadent result, you can line the dish with a small amount of butter to give it an extra rich flavor.</p><h3 id=step-3-combine-the-corn-ingredients>Step 3: Combine the Corn Ingredients</h3><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the <strong>whole kernel corn</strong> (drained if using canned), <strong>creamed corn</strong>, and <strong>melted butter</strong>. The combination of whole and creamed corn creates the perfect balance of texture and flavor, while the butter enhances the richness of the pudding. Stir until the corn and butter are well incorporated.</p><h3 id=step-4-mix-the-wet-ingredients>Step 4: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3><p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the <strong>eggs</strong>, <strong>heavy cream</strong>, <strong>milk</strong>, <strong>salt</strong>, <strong>pepper</strong>, <strong>garlic powder</strong>, and <strong>onion powder</strong>. These ingredients will form the custard base of your corn pudding, which is what gives the dish its creamy, smooth texture. If you prefer a slightly sweeter pudding, you can add a tablespoon of sugar to the mixture, but the natural sweetness of the corn is usually enough.</p><h3 id=step-5-add-the-dry-ingredients>Step 5: Add the Dry Ingredients</h3><p>Add the <strong>cornbread mix</strong> (or cornmeal) to the wet mixture, along with the optional <strong>baking powder</strong>. This helps bind the pudding together and adds a bit of fluffiness to the final result. Stir until everything is fully combined and no dry pockets remain. The cornbread mix or cornmeal provides a bit of structure to the pudding, preventing it from becoming too runny.</p><h3 id=step-6-combine-wet-and-dry-ingredients>Step 6: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3><p>Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the corn mixture. Gently stir everything together until well combined. You want to ensure that the eggs and cream are evenly distributed throughout the corn and dry ingredients. This will help the pudding bake uniformly, resulting in a smooth, creamy texture.</p><h3 id=step-7-pour-into-the-baking-dish>Step 7: Pour Into the Baking Dish</h3><p>Once your mixture is fully combined, pour it into the prepared baking dish. Use a spatula to spread the mixture evenly across the surface, ensuring it fills the dish to the edges.</p><h3 id=step-8-bake-the-corn-pudding>Step 8: Bake the Corn Pudding</h3><p>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for <strong>45-55 minutes</strong>, or until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. You may notice a slight puffiness around the edges as the pudding bakes, which is perfectly normal. If the pudding is not fully set after the initial baking time, continue baking for another 5-10 minutes, checking for doneness.</p><h3 id=step-9-let-it-cool>Step 9: Let It Cool</h3><p>Once the corn pudding is done, remove it from the oven and allow it to cool for about 10 minutes before serving. This resting time helps the pudding firm up a bit, making it easier to cut into squares or scoop onto plates.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-perfect-corn-pudding>Tips for the Perfect Corn Pudding</h2><p>To make sure your Thanksgiving corn pudding turns out perfectly, here are a few tips and tricks to keep in mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Use fresh corn</strong>: If it&rsquo;s the right time of year, using fresh corn on the cob will provide the best flavor. Just cook the corn kernels first and cut them off the cob before adding them to the dish.</li><li><strong>Make it ahead</strong>: Corn pudding can be made a day ahead of time and stored in the refrigerator. Just cover it tightly with plastic wrap or foil. When ready to serve, reheat it in the oven at 350°F for about 20 minutes until heated through.</li><li><strong>Customize the flavor</strong>: Feel free to experiment with seasonings. A dash of paprika or cayenne pepper can add a little heat, or you can include fresh herbs like thyme or rosemary for a more aromatic flavor.</li><li><strong>Add cheese</strong>: For a cheesy variation, consider adding shredded cheddar or Monterey Jack cheese to the corn pudding mixture. This will give the dish a gooey, savory layer of flavor.</li><li><strong>For a lighter version</strong>: If you&rsquo;re looking for a lighter alternative, you can substitute the heavy cream with half-and-half or use skim milk instead of whole milk. You can also reduce the amount of butter for a less rich dish.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-serve-corn-pudding>How to Serve Corn Pudding</h2><p>Corn pudding is a versatile dish that can be served in various ways. It pairs wonderfully with the traditional Thanksgiving turkey, ham, or roast beef, and complements other side dishes like mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and stuffing. Because it’s a comforting, creamy dish, it can also be served as part of a larger buffet-style meal, giving guests the option to indulge in as much as they want.</p><p>Corn pudding is best served warm, and you can cut it into squares or scoop it with a spoon for a more rustic presentation. For an added touch, garnish with chopped fresh parsley or a sprinkle of paprika to give it a pop of color.</p><h2 id=variations-on-corn-pudding>Variations on Corn Pudding</h2><p>While the classic recipe is delicious on its own, corn pudding is highly adaptable. You can customize it based on your preferences or the dietary needs of your guests. Here are a few variations to try:</p><ul><li><strong>Spicy Corn Pudding</strong>: Add diced jalapeños or a pinch of chili powder to the mixture for a spicy kick.</li><li><strong>Bacon Corn Pudding</strong>: Stir in crispy, crumbled bacon for added flavor and texture. Bacon&rsquo;s smokiness complements the sweet corn perfectly.</li><li><strong>Vegetarian Corn Pudding</strong>: This dish is naturally vegetarian. However, if you want to make it vegan, substitute the eggs with a flax egg and the dairy with plant-based alternatives like almond milk and vegan butter.</li><li><strong>Creamy Corn Pudding with Herbs</strong>: Add finely chopped fresh herbs like thyme, rosemary, or sage to infuse your corn pudding with aromatic flavors. These herbs are especially great if you&rsquo;re serving the pudding with roasted meats.</li></ul><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Thanksgiving corn pudding is an easy, crowd-pleasing dish that adds a touch of comfort and warmth to your holiday meal. With its creamy texture, sweet corn flavor, and versatility, it’s the perfect side dish to complement your turkey and stuffing. Whether you follow the classic recipe or experiment with your own variations, this corn pudding will be a hit at your Thanksgiving dinner.</p><p>With just a few simple ingredients and minimal prep time, you’ll be able to prepare a dish that will become a holiday tradition for years to come.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/categories/thanksgiving-recipes/>Thanksgiving Recipes</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/how-to-make-thanksgiving-chocolate-pecan-pie/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>How to Make Thanksgiving Chocolate Pecan Pie</span>
