These ingredients are simple, wholesome, and easy to find in most grocery stores.</p><h3 id=for-the-base>For the Base:</h3><ul><li><strong>1 cup almond flour</strong>: This gives the bars a smooth, buttery texture and a slightly nutty flavor. Almond flour is also gluten-free, making it a great choice for those avoiding gluten.</li><li><strong>1/2 cup rolled oats</strong>: Oats help to bind the ingredients together and provide a chewy texture. Be sure to use certified gluten-free oats if needed.</li><li><strong>1/4 cup coconut flour</strong>: This flour adds density and a touch of coconut flavor while also helping to absorb moisture in the recipe.</li><li><strong>1/4 cup coconut oil</strong>: Coconut oil is used to provide healthy fats and moisture to the base, making the bars rich and satisfying. If you don’t like the taste of coconut, you can substitute it with another neutral oil.</li><li><strong>2 tablespoons maple syrup</strong>: For natural sweetness, maple syrup is an excellent choice. It adds just the right amount of sweetness without overpowering the other flavors.</li><li><strong>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</strong>: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the bars, adding a warm, aromatic note.</li><li><strong>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</strong>: To help the base rise slightly, making the texture light and airy.</li><li><strong>Pinch of salt</strong>: To balance the sweetness and enhance all the other flavors.</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-topping>For the Topping:</h3><ul><li><strong>1 cup dried cherries</strong>: Cherries are the star of the show here, providing a tart and juicy bite that pairs perfectly with the almonds. You can use fresh cherries if they are in season, but dried cherries are more convenient for year-round use.</li><li><strong>1/2 cup sliced almonds</strong>: Almonds add crunch, flavor, and nutritional value. You can toast them lightly to bring out their natural oils and enhance the taste.</li><li><strong>2 tablespoons maple syrup or agave nectar</strong>: A bit more liquid sweetener to drizzle over the top for an extra touch of sweetness.</li><li><strong>2 tablespoons almond butter</strong>: This adds richness and depth to the topping, creating a luxurious layer on top of the cherry almond base.</li><li><strong>Optional: A few tablespoons of shredded coconut or crushed nuts for extra texture</strong>: If you like a bit of extra crunch or coconut flavor, feel free to add these as a topping.</li></ul><h2 id=step-by-step-instructions-for-vegan-cherry-almond-bars>Step-by-Step Instructions for Vegan Cherry Almond Bars</h2><p>Now that we’ve gathered all our ingredients, it’s time to get baking! These vegan cherry almond bars are straightforward to make and require minimal effort. Let’s walk through the steps together.</p><h3 id=step-1-preheat-the-oven-and-prepare-the-baking-dish>Step 1: Preheat the Oven and Prepare the Baking Dish</h3><p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). While the oven is heating, line an 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper. This will make it much easier to remove the bars once they are baked and ensure they don’t stick.</p><h3 id=step-2-mix-the-dry-ingredients>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the almond flour, rolled oats, coconut flour, baking soda, and a pinch of salt. Stir these ingredients together until they are well distributed. The oat and almond flour mixture will provide the foundation for the base.</p><h3 id=step-3-add-the-wet-ingredients>Step 3: Add the Wet Ingredients</h3><p>Next, add the coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Stir everything together using a spatula or spoon until the dough begins to come together. The coconut oil will melt into the dry ingredients, creating a sticky dough.</p><h3 id=step-4-press-the-base-into-the-pan>Step 4: Press the Base Into the Pan</h3><p>Once your dough is ready, transfer it to the prepared baking pan. Use the back of a spoon or your hands to press the dough evenly into the bottom of the pan. Make sure the surface is smooth and uniform to ensure even baking.</p><h3 id=step-5-bake-the-base>Step 5: Bake the Base</h3><p>Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until the base is golden brown and firm to the touch. Keep an eye on it, as ovens vary, and you want to avoid overbaking. Once done, remove the pan from the oven and let it cool for about 10 minutes while you prepare the topping.</p><h3 id=step-6-prepare-the-topping>Step 6: Prepare the Topping</h3><p>While the base is cooling, it’s time to prepare the cherry almond topping. In a small bowl, mix the dried cherries, sliced almonds, and almond butter. Add maple syrup or agave nectar to this mixture, and stir well until the cherries and almonds are evenly coated.</p><h3 id=step-7-assemble-the-bars>Step 7: Assemble the Bars</h3><p>Once the base has cooled slightly, spread the cherry and almond topping evenly over the baked base. Press it down gently with your hands to ensure the topping sticks.</p><h3 id=step-8-bake-the-bars>Step 8: Bake the Bars</h3><p>Return the pan to the oven and bake for an additional 10-12 minutes. The topping should become slightly golden, and the cherries should soften, releasing their natural juices.</p><h3 id=step-9-let-the-bars-cool>Step 9: Let the Bars Cool</h3><p>After baking, remove the pan from the oven and allow the bars to cool completely in the pan. Once they’ve cooled to room temperature, use a sharp knife to slice them into squares or rectangles. You can store these bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week or refrigerate them for longer shelf life.</p><h2 id=tips-and-variations-for-perfect-vegan-cherry-almond-bars>Tips and Variations for Perfect Vegan Cherry Almond Bars</h2><ul><li><strong>For extra flavor</strong>: Add a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg to the base dough to enhance the warmth of the bars.</li><li><strong>Use fresh cherries</strong>: If cherries are in season, you can substitute the dried cherries with fresh, pitted cherries. Just be sure to chop them into smaller pieces to ensure even distribution.</li><li><strong>Make it gluten-free</strong>: This recipe is naturally gluten-free as long as you use certified gluten-free oats and ensure the almond flour and coconut flour are pure and unadulterated.</li><li><strong>Add a touch of chocolate</strong>: If you’re craving chocolate, consider adding some dairy-free chocolate chips to the topping. They’ll pair beautifully with the cherries and almonds, creating a decadent treat.</li></ul><h2 id=the-health-benefits-of-vegan-cherry-almond-bars>The Health Benefits of Vegan Cherry Almond Bars</h2><p>In addition to being a delicious and satisfying dessert, vegan cherry almond bars are packed with numerous health benefits.</p><h3 id=high-in-antioxidants>High in Antioxidants</h3><p>Cherries are loaded with antioxidants, which help protect the body from oxidative damage. This can support your overall immune health and may even reduce inflammation.

They also provide a good source of magnesium, which supports cardiovascular health and muscle function.</p><h3 id=full-of-fiber>Full of Fiber</h3><p>The oats and almonds in these bars provide a significant amount of fiber, which helps promote digestion and keeps you feeling full longer.
