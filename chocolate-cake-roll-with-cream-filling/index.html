Whether you&rsquo;re baking for a special occasion, a holiday, or simply satisfying your sweet tooth, this cake roll is bound to be a showstopper. In this post, we’ll walk you through the process of making a flawless chocolate cake roll, from preparing the cake batter to rolling it up with a creamy, dreamy filling.</p><h2 id=what-is-a-chocolate-cake-roll>What Is a Chocolate Cake Roll?</h2><p>A chocolate cake roll is a type of sponge cake that is baked in a sheet pan, filled with a luscious cream filling, and then rolled up into a beautiful spiral shape. Unlike a traditional layer cake, the cake is thin and light, making it easier to roll without cracking. The end result is a moist, fluffy cake with a smooth and creamy filling, all wrapped up in a beautiful spiral.</p><h2 id=ingredients-youll-need>Ingredients You&rsquo;ll Need</h2><p>Before we dive into the step-by-step instructions, let&rsquo;s take a look at the ingredients that will come together to create this dessert masterpiece.</p><h3 id=for-the-chocolate-cake>For the Chocolate Cake:</h3><ul><li>4 large eggs</li><li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li><li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li><li>1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li><li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li><li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><li>1/4 cup warm water</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-cream-filling>For the Cream Filling:</h3><ul><li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li><li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><li>4 oz cream cheese, softened</li><li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder (optional, for extra chocolate flavor)</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-dusting-optional>For the Dusting (Optional):</h3><ul><li>Powdered sugar, for dusting the top</li></ul><h3 id=equipment-needed>Equipment Needed:</h3><ul><li>A 10x15 inch jelly roll pan</li><li>Parchment paper</li><li>Hand mixer or stand mixer</li><li>Mixing bowls</li><li>Sifter for cocoa powder</li><li>A sharp knife for cutting the cake roll</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-make-chocolate-cake-roll-with-cream-filling>How to Make Chocolate Cake Roll with Cream Filling</h2><h3 id=step-1-preheat-the-oven-and-prepare-the-pan>Step 1: Preheat the Oven and Prepare the Pan</h3><p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan with parchment paper. It’s essential to line the pan with parchment paper to ensure that the cake doesn’t stick and to make the rolling process much easier. If you don’t have a jelly roll pan, you can also use a 9x13-inch baking sheet, but the shape may not be as perfect.</p><h3 id=step-2-make-the-chocolate-cake-batter>Step 2: Make the Chocolate Cake Batter</h3><p>In a medium-sized bowl, sift together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. This will ensure that your cake has a smooth texture without any lumps of cocoa powder.</p><p>In a separate large bowl, beat the eggs and sugar together using a hand mixer or stand mixer on medium-high speed until the mixture becomes pale and fluffy. This usually takes about 5-7 minutes. The goal is to incorporate as much air into the mixture as possible, giving your cake its light texture.</p><p>Once the egg-sugar mixture is light and airy, add the vanilla extract and warm water. Mix just to combine.</p><p>Now, gradually fold in the dry ingredients into the egg mixture. Be careful not to deflate the batter. You can use a spatula or a whisk to gently fold everything together until just combined. The batter should be thick and smooth but still light.</p><h3 id=step-3-bake-the-chocolate-cake>Step 3: Bake the Chocolate Cake</h3><p>Pour the batter into the prepared jelly roll pan, spreading it out evenly with a spatula. Make sure the batter is level across the pan to ensure even baking. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the cake springs back when lightly touched.</p><p>While the cake is baking, prepare a clean kitchen towel. Once the cake is out of the oven, immediately invert it onto the prepared towel (remove the parchment paper). Carefully peel off the parchment paper from the back of the cake. Now, starting from one end, gently roll the cake and towel together. Allow the cake to cool completely in its rolled-up shape. This step helps the cake retain its ability to roll without cracking once it’s filled.</p><h3 id=step-4-prepare-the-cream-filling>Step 4: Prepare the Cream Filling</h3><p>While the cake is cooling, you can prepare the luscious cream filling. Start by placing the cream cheese in a medium bowl and beating it with a hand mixer until smooth. Add the heavy whipping cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract to the bowl, and continue mixing until soft peaks form. The whipped cream should be light and fluffy, and it should hold its shape when you lift the beaters out of the mixture.</p><p>If you want to take the filling to the next level, you can add cocoa powder to the cream mixture for a more chocolatey flavor. Just sift the cocoa powder into the whipped cream mixture and beat until fully incorporated.</p><h3 id=step-5-unroll-the-cake-and-fill-it>Step 5: Unroll the Cake and Fill It</h3><p>Once the cake has completely cooled, carefully unroll it from the towel. Be gentle during this step to avoid cracking the cake. You should now have a flat chocolate cake that’s ready to be filled.</p><p>Spread a generous layer of the cream filling over the entire surface of the cake, leaving a small border around the edges. Be sure to spread the filling evenly, making it as smooth as possible to get that perfect swirl when you roll it back up.</p><h3 id=step-6-roll-the-cake-back-up>Step 6: Roll the Cake Back Up</h3><p>Now, it’s time to roll the cake. Starting from the edge where you began unrolling, carefully roll the cake back up into its spiral shape. Try to do this gently but firmly, so the filling doesn’t spill out. The cake should easily roll back into place without cracking, thanks to the initial rolling process and the moistness of the cake.</p><p>Once the cake is rolled, place it seam-side down on a serving platter. If there’s any excess filling spilling out from the ends, you can gently trim the edges with a sharp knife.</p><h3 id=step-7-chill-the-cake>Step 7: Chill the Cake</h3><p>For the best results, it’s recommended to chill the cake roll in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before serving. This will help the filling set and make slicing easier.</p><h3 id=step-8-dust-with-powdered-sugar-optional>Step 8: Dust with Powdered Sugar (Optional)</h3><p>Before serving, you can dust the top of the chocolate cake roll with a light coating of powdered sugar for an elegant touch. This is optional but adds a nice finishing touch to your creation.</p><h3 id=step-9-slice-and-serve>Step 9: Slice and Serve</h3><p>Once chilled, slice the cake into generous pieces, revealing that beautiful spiral of chocolate cake and creamy filling inside. Serve as a dessert for a dinner party, birthday celebration, or simply as a sweet treat to enjoy with your afternoon tea.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-perfect-chocolate-cake-roll>Tips for the Perfect Chocolate Cake Roll</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Use Fresh Eggs</strong>: For the fluffiest cake, use fresh eggs. The eggs are a crucial component in creating the airy texture of the cake, so fresh eggs will give you the best results.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter</strong>: When combining the dry ingredients with the egg mixture, be sure to fold them gently. Overmixing can cause the cake to become dense, which can make it harder to roll.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cooling Time Is Key</strong>: Don’t rush the cooling process. Let the cake cool completely before you unroll it. If you try to unroll it too early, the cake might crack.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chill the Cake</strong>: Chilling the cake for an hour after rolling it will help everything set. It also makes it much easier to slice and serve.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customize the Filling</strong>: While the classic cream filling is delicious, feel free to get creative! Add a touch of coffee liqueur for a mocha flavor, or mix in some crushed chocolate or peppermint for a unique twist.</p></li></ol><h2 id=variations-to-try>Variations to Try</h2><p>While the chocolate cake roll with cream filling is already a crowd-pleaser, you can get creative with different flavors and fillings. Here are a few ideas to inspire you:</p><h3 id=mocha-cake-roll>Mocha Cake Roll</h3><p>For a coffee lover’s twist, try adding a teaspoon of instant coffee granules to the cake batter. You can also mix a little coffee extract into the cream filling for a mocha-flavored cake roll.</p><h3 id=strawberry-cake-roll>Strawberry Cake Roll</h3><p>Instead of a classic cream filling, opt for fresh whipped cream mixed with chopped strawberries. The juicy fruit will add a refreshing touch to the rich chocolate cake.</p><h3 id=nutella-cake-roll>Nutella Cake Roll</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re a fan of hazelnut chocolate spreads, swap out the cream filling for Nutella. You can even swirl the Nutella directly into the cake batter for an extra chocolatey experience.</p><h3 id=gluten-free-cake-roll>Gluten-Free Cake Roll</h3><p>For a gluten-free version, simply substitute the all-purpose flour with a gluten-free flour blend. Make sure to also use certified gluten-free cocoa powder and check that your other ingredients are gluten-free.</p><h2 id=why-youll-love-this-recipe>Why You’ll Love This Recipe</h2><ul><li><strong>Impressive Yet Simple</strong>: While a chocolate cake roll looks elegant, it’s surprisingly easy to make, even for beginners.</li><li><strong>Perfect for Any Occasion</strong>: Whether you&rsquo;re baking for a birthday, holiday, or just because, this dessert is sure to impress your guests.</li><li><strong>Customizable</strong>: From different fillings to flavor variations, you can tailor this cake roll to suit your taste and preferences.</li><li><strong>Deliciously Moist and Light</strong>: The light, fluffy texture of the cake and the rich, creamy filling make each bite melt in your mouth.</li></ul><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h2><p>A chocolate cake roll with cream filling is an irresistibly delicious dessert that is perfect for any occasion.
