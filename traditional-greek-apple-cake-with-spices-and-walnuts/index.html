It’s moist, full of flavor, and has just the right balance of sweetness and spice. Let’s dive into this timeless Greek recipe.</p><h2 id=ingredients-for-traditional-greek-apple-cake>Ingredients for Traditional Greek Apple Cake</h2><p>Before you start baking, it’s important to gather all the ingredients you’ll need. Luckily, these ingredients are commonly found in most kitchens, making this cake a convenient and accessible treat to prepare. The following ingredients will yield about 8 to 10 servings:</p><h3 id=dry-ingredients>Dry Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li><li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li><li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li><li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li><li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li><li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li><li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li><li>1 cup chopped walnuts (lightly toasted for extra flavor)</li></ul><h3 id=wet-ingredients>Wet Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>1 cup vegetable oil (or any neutral oil of your choice)</li><li>1 cup granulated sugar</li><li>2 large eggs, room temperature</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li><li>1 tablespoon lemon juice (freshly squeezed)</li><li>1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt (adds moisture and depth)</li></ul><h3 id=apples>Apples:</h3><ul><li>3 medium-sized apples, peeled, cored, and chopped into small chunks (a mix of tart and sweet apples is ideal, such as Granny Smith and Honeycrisp)</li></ul><h3 id=optional-garnish>Optional Garnish:</h3><ul><li>Powdered sugar for dusting</li><li>Additional chopped walnuts for topping</li></ul><h2 id=instructions-for-preparing-the-cake>Instructions for Preparing the Cake</h2><h3 id=step-1-preheat-the-oven-and-prepare-the-pan>Step 1: Preheat the Oven and Prepare the Pan</h3><p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round or square cake pan. You can also line the bottom with parchment paper to make it easier to remove the cake after baking.</p><h3 id=step-2-prepare-the-dry-ingredients>Step 2: Prepare the Dry Ingredients</h3><p>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and salt. The combination of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger gives this cake its signature Greek spiced aroma, reminiscent of cozy, autumnal desserts. Once mixed, set the dry ingredients aside.</p><h3 id=step-3-mix-the-wet-ingredients>Step 3: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the vegetable oil and sugar. Whisk together until smooth and slightly creamy. Next, add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla extract, lemon juice, and Greek yogurt, and whisk again until the mixture is completely combined. The yogurt will give the cake a subtle tang and extra moisture, which helps create a soft texture.</p><h3 id=step-4-incorporate-the-dry-ingredients>Step 4: Incorporate the Dry Ingredients</h3><p>Gradually add the dry ingredients into the wet mixture. Stir gently with a spatula or wooden spoon until just combined—be careful not to overmix, as this could result in a dense texture. The batter should be thick but smooth, holding its shape when spooned.</p><h3 id=step-5-fold-in-the-apples-and-walnuts>Step 5: Fold in the Apples and Walnuts</h3><p>Once your batter is prepared, gently fold in the chopped apples and toasted walnuts. Be sure to distribute them evenly throughout the batter, but again, avoid overmixing to keep the cake light and fluffy.</p><h3 id=step-6-bake-the-cake>Step 6: Bake the Cake</h3><p>Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, or until the cake is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with just a few moist crumbs attached. Keep an eye on the cake as it bakes—if the top is browning too quickly, you can cover it loosely with aluminum foil.</p><h3 id=step-7-let-the-cake-cool>Step 7: Let the Cake Cool</h3><p>Once the cake is done, remove it from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. After that, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. This helps prevent the cake from becoming soggy by allowing air to circulate around it.</p><h3 id=step-8-garnish-and-serve>Step 8: Garnish and Serve</h3><p>Once your cake has cooled, you can add a finishing touch by dusting the top with a light coating of powdered sugar. For added texture and flavor, sprinkle some chopped walnuts on top. The nuts will add a delightful crunch and enhance the overall taste of the cake.</p><p>Cut the cake into slices and serve with a hot cup of coffee or a glass of sweet Greek dessert wine, such as Muscat or Retsina, for a perfect treat.</p><h2 id=why-this-greek-apple-cake-is-special>Why This Greek Apple Cake is Special</h2><p>This cake is a beloved part of Greek home baking, especially in the colder months when apples are in season. The combination of spices—cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger—gives it a warmth and depth that transports you to the heart of the Mediterranean. These spices are staples in Greek baking, often found in both sweet and savory dishes, lending an unmistakable flavor that’s cherished across generations.</p><p>The addition of Greek yogurt is another standout feature of this recipe. Yogurt is an essential ingredient in many Greek desserts, and it serves to add a creamy texture to the cake. Greek yogurt also offers a slight tanginess that complements the sweetness of the apples and balances the richness of the cake. It’s this balance of flavors—spices, sweetness, tanginess, and nuttiness—that makes this cake so irresistible.</p><p>The walnuts are another nod to traditional Greek flavors. Walnuts are often used in Greek sweets, from honey-soaked pastries to cakes like this one. They provide a crunchy texture that contrasts beautifully with the soft, moist cake and add an earthy, nutty flavor that’s impossible to overlook.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-perfect-greek-apple-cake>Tips for the Perfect Greek Apple Cake</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Use the Right Apples</strong>: The apples you choose will have a significant impact on the flavor and texture of the cake. A mix of tart and sweet apples is ideal. Granny Smith apples add a tartness that balances the sweetness of the cake, while Honeycrisp apples lend natural sweetness and moisture.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t Overmix the Batter</strong>: When adding the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, be careful not to overmix. Overmixing can lead to a dense cake that lacks the light and fluffy texture we all desire. Stir until just combined, and you’ll be rewarded with a soft and airy dessert.</p></li><li><p><strong>Toast the Walnuts</strong>: Toasting the walnuts before adding them to the batter brings out their natural oils and intensifies their flavor. You can toast the walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat for about 5 minutes or place them in the oven for a few minutes until they’re lightly golden.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Freshly Ground Spices</strong>: For the best flavor, use freshly ground spices rather than pre-ground ones. Freshly ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger will give the cake an extra aromatic punch and a more vibrant flavor profile.</p></li><li><p><strong>Allow the Cake to Cool Completely</strong>: While it’s tempting to slice the cake while it’s still warm, allow it to cool completely before cutting. This ensures that the cake sets properly and slices neatly, without falling apart.</p></li></ol><h2 id=variations-on-the-greek-apple-cake>Variations on the Greek Apple Cake</h2><p>While the classic version of this Greek apple cake is already packed with flavor, there are a few variations you can experiment with to suit your preferences or available ingredients. Here are a few ideas:</p><ul><li><strong>Add Raisins or Dried Figs</strong>: For an extra layer of sweetness and texture, add a handful of raisins or chopped dried figs to the batter. These dried fruits pair beautifully with the apples and spices.</li><li><strong>Citrus Zest</strong>: Incorporate the zest of an orange or lemon into the batter for a burst of citrusy freshness that complements the apples and spices.</li><li><strong>Substitute Honey for Sugar</strong>: For a more traditional twist, try substituting the granulated sugar with honey. This will add a subtle floral sweetness and enhance the cake&rsquo;s Greek roots.</li></ul><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>This traditional Greek apple cake with spices and walnuts is more than just a dessert—it&rsquo;s a slice of Greek culture and culinary tradition, filled with warmth and comfort. The balance of apples, spices, and walnuts makes each bite a delicious experience, while the moist, tender cake offers the perfect base for all these flavors to shine. Whether you’re sharing it with family and friends or enjoying it on your own with a cup of tea, this Greek apple cake will transport you straight to the heart of Greece, one bite at a time.</p><p>Happy baking!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/categories/greek-cuisine/>Greek Cuisine</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/traditional-baklava-variations-across-greek-regions-recipe/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Traditional Baklava Variations Across Greek Regions Recipe</span>
