With a rich, buttery dough and a luscious glaze, these sweet yeast rolls are sure to impress.</p><p>In this guide, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of creating perfect sweet yeast rolls with a delicious glaze. From mixing the dough to baking and glazing the rolls, we’ve got you covered with tips and tricks to ensure success every time.</p><h3 id=ingredients-for-sweet-yeast-rolls>Ingredients for Sweet Yeast Rolls</h3><p>To make sweet yeast rolls, you&rsquo;ll need to gather the following ingredients:</p><h4 id=for-the-dough>For the Dough:</h4><ul><li><strong>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</strong> (plus extra for dusting)</li><li><strong>1 packet active dry yeast</strong> (about 2 ¼ teaspoons)</li><li><strong>¾ cup whole milk</strong> (warm, around 110°F)</li><li><strong>¼ cup granulated sugar</strong></li><li><strong>2 large eggs</strong></li><li><strong>⅓ cup unsalted butter</strong> (softened)</li><li><strong>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</strong></li><li><strong>1 teaspoon salt</strong></li></ul><h4 id=for-the-glaze>For the Glaze:</h4><ul><li><strong>½ cup powdered sugar</strong></li><li><strong>1 tablespoon whole milk</strong></li><li><strong>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</strong></li></ul><p>These simple ingredients are all you need to create a delightful batch of sweet yeast rolls. The combination of milk, butter, eggs, and sugar gives the dough its soft texture and slight sweetness, while the glaze adds the perfect finishing touch with its sweet and glossy shine.</p><h3 id=step-by-step-instructions-for-making-sweet-yeast-rolls>Step-by-Step Instructions for Making Sweet Yeast Rolls</h3><p>Making sweet yeast rolls is a process that requires patience, but don’t worry—it’s easier than you might think. Follow these steps to create perfect rolls that will melt in your mouth.</p><h4 id=step-1-proof-the-yeast>Step 1: Proof the Yeast</h4><p>Start by proofing the yeast. In a small bowl, combine the warm milk (about 110°F) with the granulated sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Sprinkle the active dry yeast over the surface of the milk mixture, then let it sit for about 5-10 minutes. You should see the mixture begin to bubble and foam as the yeast activates. This process ensures that your rolls will rise beautifully.</p><h4 id=step-2-prepare-the-dough>Step 2: Prepare the Dough</h4><p>Once the yeast is activated, it&rsquo;s time to mix the dough. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine 3 cups of all-purpose flour and the salt. Stir in the yeast mixture along with the eggs, softened butter, and vanilla extract. Use the dough hook attachment on your stand mixer and knead the dough on medium speed for about 5-7 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. If the dough feels too sticky, you can gradually add more flour, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency.</p><p>Alternatively, if you don’t have a stand mixer, you can mix the ingredients by hand in a large bowl. Start by combining the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients and mix until a sticky dough forms. Then, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead by hand for 8-10 minutes until smooth.</p><h4 id=step-3-first-rise>Step 3: First Rise</h4><p>After kneading the dough, form it into a ball and place it in a lightly greased bowl. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and set it in a warm place to rise for about 1-2 hours. The dough should double in size. If your kitchen is cold, you can place the bowl in the oven with the oven light on to create a warm environment for the dough to rise.</p><h4 id=step-4-shape-the-rolls>Step 4: Shape the Rolls</h4><p>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and divide it into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece of dough into a smooth ball by pinching the edges underneath to create a taut surface.</p><p>Arrange the dough balls in a greased 9x13-inch baking dish, leaving a little space between them. The rolls should touch each other but not be overcrowded. This will help them rise and bake evenly.</p><h4 id=step-5-second-rise>Step 5: Second Rise</h4><p>Cover the baking dish with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let the rolls rise again for 30-60 minutes. They should puff up and almost double in size. The second rise is crucial for ensuring that the rolls are soft and fluffy.</p><h4 id=step-6-bake-the-rolls>Step 6: Bake the Rolls</h4><p>While the rolls are rising, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Once the rolls have risen, place them in the oven and bake for 18-22 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. You can test the rolls by gently tapping on the top; they should sound hollow. If you prefer a softer crust, you can cover the rolls with foil during the last 5 minutes of baking.</p><h4 id=step-7-make-the-glaze>Step 7: Make the Glaze</h4><p>While the rolls are baking, prepare the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract. The glaze should be smooth and pourable. If you prefer a thicker glaze, you can add a little more powdered sugar; for a thinner glaze, add more milk until it reaches your desired consistency.</p><h4 id=step-8-glaze-the-rolls>Step 8: Glaze the Rolls</h4><p>Once the rolls are baked and golden, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes. While the rolls are still warm, drizzle the glaze over the top. The glaze will soak into the rolls slightly, adding sweetness and shine.</p><h4 id=step-9-serve-and-enjoy>Step 9: Serve and Enjoy</h4><p>Allow the rolls to cool slightly before serving. These sweet yeast rolls are best enjoyed fresh but can also be stored in an airtight container for a couple of days. They can be reheated in the microwave for a few seconds if you prefer them warm.</p><h3 id=tips-for-success>Tips for Success</h3><p>While making sweet yeast rolls is a straightforward process, there are a few tips that can help you achieve the best results:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Don’t rush the rising process.</strong> Yeast doughs need time to rise, so be patient. If your dough isn’t rising as quickly as expected, make sure the yeast is active and your kitchen is warm enough.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use room temperature ingredients.</strong> When adding butter, eggs, and other ingredients to the dough, ensure that they are at room temperature. Cold ingredients can slow down the yeast’s activity, leading to dense rolls.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add flavor variations.</strong> While these rolls are delicious on their own, you can customize them with flavor add-ins. Try adding a teaspoon of cinnamon or nutmeg to the dough for a warm, spiced flavor. You can also fold in raisins, chopped nuts, or even chocolate chips for a fun twist.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ensure proper flour measurement.</strong> For the best texture, make sure to measure your flour correctly. Spoon the flour into the measuring cup and level it off with a knife rather than scooping it directly from the bag. This will prevent the dough from becoming too dense.</p></li><li><p><strong>Check for doneness.</strong> Always check the rolls toward the end of baking by tapping them or checking the internal temperature. The rolls are done when they reach about 190°F (88°C) inside.</p></li></ul><h3 id=why-these-sweet-yeast-rolls-are-special>Why These Sweet Yeast Rolls are Special</h3><p>Sweet yeast rolls stand out from other baked goods due to their soft, fluffy texture and delicate sweetness. The yeast works its magic to create a light and airy crumb, while the glaze adds a glossy, sugary finish that takes the rolls to the next level.</p><p>These rolls are versatile, too. You can enjoy them for breakfast with a cup of coffee, as a side dish at dinner, or as a dessert with a dollop of whipped cream. Their warm, comforting aroma and melt-in-your-mouth texture make them a go-to choice for any occasion, from family gatherings to holiday meals.</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>Making sweet yeast rolls with a delicious glaze is a fun and rewarding baking project that results in soft, fluffy rolls with a rich flavor.
