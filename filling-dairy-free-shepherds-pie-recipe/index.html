From sautéing the vegetables to creating a creamy mashed potato topping, we will guide you through each process to ensure your dish turns out perfectly.</p><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-potatoes-for-mashing>Step 1: Prepare the Potatoes for Mashing</h3><p>Start by peeling and cubing the potatoes. Place them in a large pot and cover them with water. Bring the pot to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cook the potatoes for about 10-12 minutes, or until they are fork-tender. Once cooked, drain the potatoes and return them to the pot.</p><p>While the potatoes are still hot, mash them using a potato masher or a hand mixer. Add the dairy-free butter and almond milk (or your preferred non-dairy milk), and continue mashing until the potatoes reach a smooth and creamy consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.</p><h3 id=step-2-make-the-filling>Step 2: Make the Filling</h3><p>While the potatoes are cooking, you can begin working on the filling. Start by heating the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for about 5 minutes, or until softened and translucent. Add the minced garlic and sauté for an additional minute until fragrant.</p><p>Next, add the diced carrots and chopped celery to the skillet. Cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften. At this point, you can add the ground meat (or plant-based ground meat). Break it up with a spoon or spatula and cook until browned and cooked through, about 8-10 minutes.</p><p>Once the meat is browned, stir in the tomato paste and cook for another 2 minutes. Then, pour in the vegetable broth and soy sauce (or tamari). Add the dried thyme and rosemary, and stir everything together. Allow the mixture to simmer for 5-7 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced and the filling has thickened slightly.</p><p>Finally, add the peas and stir them in. Taste the filling and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed. Once everything is well-combined and flavorful, remove the skillet from the heat.</p><h3 id=step-3-assemble-the-shepherds-pie>Step 3: Assemble the Shepherd’s Pie</h3><p>Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</p><p>To assemble the shepherd’s pie, spoon the meat and vegetable filling into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Spread it evenly across the dish to create a uniform layer. Next, carefully spoon the mashed potatoes over the top of the filling. Use a spatula to smooth the potatoes into an even layer.</p><p>For a decorative touch, use a fork to create small peaks on the surface of the mashed potatoes. This will help them crisp up nicely in the oven and create an appealing texture.</p><h3 id=step-4-bake-the-shepherds-pie>Step 4: Bake the Shepherd’s Pie</h3><p>Place the assembled shepherd’s pie in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the mashed potatoes are golden brown and the edges are slightly crispy. You can also broil the pie for 2-3 minutes at the end of the cooking time to get the top even more golden and crisp, but be sure to keep an eye on it to avoid burning.</p><h3 id=step-5-serve-and-enjoy>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Once the shepherd’s pie is out of the oven, let it rest for about 5 minutes before serving. This will allow the filling to set, making it easier to slice and serve.</p><p>Dish out generous portions and enjoy the delicious, comforting flavors of this dairy-free shepherd’s pie. It’s the perfect meal for a cozy dinner with family or friends!</p><h2 id=tips-for-a-perfect-dairy-free-shepherds-pie>Tips for a Perfect Dairy-Free Shepherd’s Pie</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Make it ahead of time:</strong> Shepherd’s pie is a great dish to prepare in advance. You can make the filling and mashed potatoes ahead of time, then assemble the pie when you’re ready to bake. You can also refrigerate the assembled pie for up to two days before baking it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Leftovers:</strong> This dish stores well in the fridge for up to three days and can be reheated in the oven or microwave. It also freezes beautifully for up to three months—just be sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap and foil before freezing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customize the filling:</strong> Feel free to add other vegetables to the filling, such as mushrooms, parsnips, or corn. You can also experiment with different herbs and spices to suit your taste.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add a topping twist:</strong> If you want a crunchy topping, try adding a layer of dairy-free breadcrumbs or crushed nuts over the mashed potatoes before baking. This will give the pie an extra texture.</p></li></ul><h2 id=why-this-recipe-is-a-winner>Why This Recipe Is a Winner</h2><p>This dairy-free shepherd’s pie recipe is not only delicious but also incredibly satisfying.
