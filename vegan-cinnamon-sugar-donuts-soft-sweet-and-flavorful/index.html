Whether you&rsquo;re enjoying them with your morning coffee or as an afternoon treat, these vegan cinnamon sugar donuts are guaranteed to hit the spot. With a light and fluffy texture and the perfect balance of sweetness, these donuts are sure to become a favorite in your vegan baking repertoire. Let’s dive into how to make these easy, delicious, and plant-based treats right in your kitchen.</p><h2 id=why-choose-vegan-donuts>Why Choose Vegan Donuts?</h2><p>Before we get to the recipe, let’s talk about why vegan donuts are a great option. Many traditional donut recipes call for dairy, eggs, and sometimes even butter, but with the right substitutions, you can create a donut that is just as delicious without any animal products. Vegan donuts are not only suitable for those following a plant-based diet, but they also cater to people with allergies to eggs or dairy.</p><p>Another benefit of vegan donuts is that they can be made with simple, everyday ingredients that you likely already have in your pantry. No need to search for specialty items! Plus, by making them at home, you can control the sweetness level, ensuring that your donuts are as sweet (or not) as you like.</p><p>Now that we’ve established why these donuts are a fantastic choice, let&rsquo;s jump into the recipe.</p><h2 id=ingredients-for-vegan-cinnamon-sugar-donuts>Ingredients for Vegan Cinnamon Sugar Donuts</h2><p>To make these soft, sweet, and flavorful vegan cinnamon sugar donuts, you will need the following ingredients:</p><h3 id=dry-ingredients>Dry Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour (you can substitute with whole wheat flour for a healthier version)</li><li>1 tablespoon baking powder (this helps the donuts rise and become fluffy)</li><li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (adds the signature cinnamon flavor)</li><li>¼ teaspoon salt (balances the sweetness and enhances the flavors)</li><li>¾ cup sugar (use organic cane sugar or coconut sugar for a more natural sweetener)</li></ul><h3 id=wet-ingredients>Wet Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>½ cup unsweetened almond milk (or any other plant-based milk like oat milk or soy milk)</li><li>¼ cup vegetable oil (or melted coconut oil for a richer taste)</li><li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (for a subtle, sweet fragrance)</li><li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (this helps activate the baking powder and creates a light texture)</li><li>¼ cup unsweetened applesauce (this is our egg replacement, helping to add moisture and richness to the donuts)</li></ul><h3 id=cinnamon-sugar-coating>Cinnamon Sugar Coating:</h3><ul><li>¼ cup sugar (for the cinnamon sugar mixture)</li><li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon (to coat the donuts in a warm, aromatic dusting)</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-make-vegan-cinnamon-sugar-donuts>How to Make Vegan Cinnamon Sugar Donuts</h2><h3 id=step-1-preheat-the-oven-and-prepare-the-pan>Step 1: Preheat the Oven and Prepare the Pan</h3><p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). While the oven is heating, prepare your donut pan. If you don’t have a donut pan, you can use a muffin tin or even a mini muffin pan to create donut holes. Grease the donut pan with a little oil or non-stick spray, or use parchment paper if you prefer.</p><h3 id=step-2-mix-the-dry-ingredients>Step 2: Mix the Dry Ingredients</h3><p>In a large bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients: all-purpose flour, baking powder, ground cinnamon, salt, and sugar. Make sure everything is evenly mixed so that the baking powder is distributed throughout the flour.</p><h3 id=step-3-combine-the-wet-ingredients>Step 3: Combine the Wet Ingredients</h3><p>In a separate bowl, mix together the wet ingredients. Pour the almond milk, vegetable oil, vanilla extract, apple cider vinegar, and applesauce into the bowl and stir well. The apple cider vinegar will combine with the baking powder and create bubbles, which helps make the donuts fluffy.</p><h3 id=step-4-combine-wet-and-dry-ingredients>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3><p>Now, it’s time to bring everything together. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to over-mix; a few lumps are perfectly fine. Over-mixing can lead to dense donuts, and we want them to stay light and fluffy.</p><h3 id=step-5-fill-the-donut-pan>Step 5: Fill the Donut Pan</h3><p>Once the batter is ready, spoon it into the prepared donut pan. You can also use a piping bag or a Ziploc bag with the tip cut off to pipe the batter into the pan for a cleaner and more even distribution. Fill each donut cavity about three-quarters full to allow space for the donuts to rise as they bake.</p><h3 id=step-6-bake-the-donuts>Step 6: Bake the Donuts</h3><p>Place the donut pan in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the donuts are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The exact baking time may vary depending on your oven and the size of your donut pan, so keep an eye on them as they bake.</p><p>Once the donuts are baked, remove them from the oven and let them cool in the pan for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p><h3 id=step-7-coat-the-donuts-in-cinnamon-sugar>Step 7: Coat the Donuts in Cinnamon Sugar</h3><p>While the donuts are cooling, it’s time to prepare the cinnamon sugar coating. In a shallow bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon. Mix until evenly combined. Once the donuts are cool enough to handle, dip each one into the cinnamon sugar mixture, coating them generously on all sides. If you want a thicker coating, you can dip the donuts back into the melted butter or oil before rolling them in the cinnamon sugar. This gives them an extra glossy finish and makes the cinnamon sugar stick even better.</p><h3 id=step-8-serve-and-enjoy>Step 8: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Now that your vegan cinnamon sugar donuts are ready, it’s time to enjoy them! Serve them fresh with a cup of coffee, tea, or even a glass of plant-based milk. They’re perfect for breakfast, brunch, or as a sweet snack to share with friends and family. The best part? These donuts are just as delicious the next day—if they last that long!</p><h2 id=tips-and-tricks-for-perfect-vegan-cinnamon-sugar-donuts>Tips and Tricks for Perfect Vegan Cinnamon Sugar Donuts</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Use room temperature ingredients</strong>: For the best results, ensure that your plant-based milk and applesauce are at room temperature before mixing them with the dry ingredients. Cold ingredients can cause the batter to firm up or create lumps, affecting the texture of your donuts.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customize your flavor</strong>: If you want to get creative, you can add other flavors to your donuts. For example, a teaspoon of nutmeg or a splash of maple syrup can elevate the flavor profile. You could also try adding chopped nuts, shredded coconut, or even a handful of vegan chocolate chips to the batter for extra texture and flavor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make mini donuts</strong>: If you prefer bite-sized treats, you can use a mini donut pan instead of a standard-sized one. The baking time may be a little shorter, so keep an eye on them to ensure they don’t over-bake.</p></li><li><p><strong>Experiment with the coating</strong>: While the cinnamon sugar coating is a classic choice, feel free to experiment with different coatings. You could try a simple glaze made from powdered sugar and almond milk, or even a chocolate glaze for a decadent twist. The possibilities are endless!</p></li></ul><h2 id=why-youll-love-these-vegan-cinnamon-sugar-donuts>Why You’ll Love These Vegan Cinnamon Sugar Donuts</h2><p>There are countless reasons to love these vegan cinnamon sugar donuts. First and foremost, they’re incredibly easy to make and require only basic ingredients.

They’re even great for dessert, especially when paired with a scoop of vegan ice cream or a drizzle of chocolate sauce.</p><h2 id=storing-and-freezing-vegan-cinnamon-sugar-donuts>Storing and Freezing Vegan Cinnamon Sugar Donuts</h2><p>If you somehow manage to have leftover donuts (unlikely, but possible!), you can easily store them for later enjoyment. Place the donuts in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. If you want to extend their shelf life, you can freeze them. To freeze, place the donuts in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze for about an hour. Then, transfer them to a freezer-safe container or Ziploc bag and store them for up to 3 months. When you’re ready to eat, simply warm them in the oven for a few minutes.</p><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h2><p>These vegan cinnamon sugar donuts are soft, sweet, and packed with flavor, making them the perfect treat for any occasion.
