Imagine tender, fall-apart pork shoulder smothered in a rich, tangy BBQ sauce, all ready and waiting for you when you need it. The beauty of this recipe lies in its simplicity - simply throw a few ingredients into a slow cooker, turn it on, and let the magic happen. In this post, we'll guide you through the process of making a mouth-watering pulled pork dish, topped with a homemade BBQ sauce that adds an extra layer of flavor.
The Power of Slow Cooking
Before we dive into the recipe, let's talk about the slow cooker's role in this dish. Slow cookers are perfect for tenderizing tougher cuts of meat like pork shoulder, which becomes incredibly soft and easily shreddable after hours of cooking. The low heat of a slow cooker also allows the meat to absorb flavors from the surrounding ingredients, resulting in a dish that's deep and well-rounded.
Ingredients
For this recipe, you'll need:</p><p>2 lbs boneless pork shoulder
1/4 cup your favorite store-bought BBQ sauce (for now, we'll set this aside as our final touch)
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 cups beef broth
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
4 hamburger buns
Coleslaw (for topping, store-bought or homemade, whichever suits your taste)</p><p>Homemade BBQ Sauce
In addition to store-bought BBQ sauce, today we'll also create a homemade BBQ sauce that complements the pork and elevates the overall dish. This sauce is reminiscent of summer picnics, backyard barbecues, and warm, sunny days.</p><p>1 cup ketchup
1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
1/4 cup water
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper
2 tablespoons butter</p><p>How it's Made</p><p>Start by seasoning your pork shoulder with salt, black pepper, smoked paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.
In a slow cooker, combine the beef broth, apple cider vinegar, and brown sugar.
Once the slow cooker is warmed up, place the seasoned pork shoulder inside and pour the liquid over it.
Set your slow cooker to low for 8 hours. Yes, 8 hours may seem like a long time, but trust us when we say that patience truly is a virtue when it comes to this dish.
While the pork cooks, toast the hamburger buns by grilling or toasting them in the oven for a few minutes.</p><p>Homemade BBQ Sauce Prep (continued)
For a deep and tangy BBQ sauce, blend the ingredients in the following recipe using a whisk:</p><p>In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low heat.
Add the ketchup, apple cider vinegar, water, brown sugar, smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper to the saucepan and whisk until combined.
Pour into a bowl, allowing it to sit for 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to mature together.
Taste and adjust as needed - we like to proceed with more sweetness by adding a pinch more sugar or more acidity with additional apple cider vinegar.</p><p>Combining the Flavors
Home stretch! As the pork finishes its 8-hour cooking cycle, you'll be able to smell the intoxicating aroma of slow-cooked pork wafting from your slow cooker. After the meeting of pork and homemade BBQ, call yourself lucky because the taste and that wrong number at your first bite will perfectly harmonize the interference from harsh ingredient
