Here’s how to do it:</p><h3 id=1-prepare-the-avocado>1. Prepare the Avocado</h3><p>Start by cutting the ripe avocado in half. Remove the pit and scoop the flesh into a small bowl. You can use a spoon to scrape the flesh directly from the skin, making sure to remove any large chunks of the seed.</p><h3 id=2-add-greek-yogurt>2. Add Greek Yogurt</h3><p>Next, add 1/2 cup of plain Greek yogurt to the bowl with the avocado. Greek yogurt is thicker than regular yogurt, which will give the sauce a creamy and smooth consistency. It’s also a great source of protein, making this sauce both nutritious and filling.</p><h3 id=3-add-lime-juice-and-olive-oil>3. Add Lime Juice and Olive Oil</h3><p>Squeeze the juice of one lime into the mixture, ensuring you avoid any seeds. The acidity from the lime will help balance the richness of the avocado and yogurt. Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to enhance the creaminess of the sauce and provide healthy fats.</p><h3 id=4-add-garlic-salt-and-pepper>4. Add Garlic, Salt, and Pepper</h3><p>Peel the garlic clove and mince it finely or crush it using a garlic press. Add the minced garlic to the bowl for a rich, savory flavor. Season with salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste.</p><h3 id=5-blend-the-ingredients>5. Blend the Ingredients</h3><p>Use a fork or a hand blender to mash and blend the ingredients until smooth. If you prefer a super silky texture, you can use a food processor or a blender for this step. Blend until the sauce reaches a creamy consistency without any large chunks.</p><h3 id=6-taste-and-adjust-seasonings>6. Taste and Adjust Seasonings</h3><p>After blending, taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings as needed. If you like a bit of spice, add chili flakes or cayenne pepper. You can also adjust the lime juice, garlic, or salt according to your preference.</p><h3 id=7-garnish-with-fresh-herbs>7. Garnish with Fresh Herbs</h3><p>Once the sauce is blended to your liking, stir in 1 tablespoon of chopped fresh cilantro if you’re using it. This adds a burst of freshness and makes the sauce even more vibrant. If cilantro isn’t your favorite, feel free to skip it or substitute with other herbs like parsley or basil.</p><h3 id=8-serve-and-enjoy>8. Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Your healthy avocado yogurt sauce is now ready to be served! You can enjoy it right away or refrigerate it for up to 3-4 days in an airtight container.
