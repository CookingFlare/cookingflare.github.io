Cook for 1-2 minutes, until the bottom is lightly browned.
Loosen the crepe with a spatula and flip it over.
Cook for another 1-2 minutes, until the other side is lightly browned.
Fill with your choice of filling and roll up or fold into quarters.</p><p>Recipe 4: Rétes - Stuffed Pastry from the Slovak-Hungarian Border
Rétes, also known as rétesi, is a type of stuffed pastry that originated in the Slovak-Hungarian border region. These savory pastries are made with a filling of meat, cheese, or vegetables, and are often served as a main dish or side.

Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 5-10 minutes, until smooth and elastic.
Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and roll out each piece into a thin sheet.
Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each sheet and fold the pastry over the filling, pressing the edges to seal.
