This recipe is easy to follow, with minimal steps involved, but the result is a flavorful and comforting dish that will have everyone asking for seconds.</p><h3 id=step-1-brown-the-ground-beef>Step 1: Brown the Ground Beef</h3><p>Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef to the pot, breaking it apart with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Brown the beef until it&rsquo;s fully cooked through, which should take about 6-8 minutes. Once browned, remove any excess fat by carefully draining it.</p><h3 id=step-2-sauté-the-vegetables>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3><p>In the same pot, add the diced onion, bell pepper, and jalapeños (if using). Sauté the vegetables for about 5 minutes, or until they’re softened and fragrant. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute, stirring constantly to prevent burning.</p><h3 id=step-3-add-the-tomato-base>Step 3: Add the Tomato Base</h3><p>Now, it’s time to build the base of your chili. Stir in the tomato paste, diced tomatoes (with their juices), and beef broth. The broth will help bring everything together, creating a rich and savory sauce that will simmer and develop more flavor as it cooks.</p><h3 id=step-4-stir-in-the-spices>Step 4: Stir in the Spices</h3><p>Next, add all the spices: chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, cocoa powder (if using), salt, black pepper, and hot sauce (if using). Stir the mixture well to ensure that all the spices are evenly distributed throughout the chili. These spices are what truly elevate the dish, creating a perfect balance of heat, smokiness, and depth.</p><h3 id=step-5-add-the-beans>Step 5: Add the Beans</h3><p>Once the spices have been stirred in, add the kidney beans and black beans to the pot. Beans are essential for providing substance and texture to the chili, as well as adding a bit of sweetness to balance the heat. Stir everything together to combine.</p><h3 id=step-6-let-it-simmer>Step 6: Let It Simmer</h3><p>Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the chili simmer for at least 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. The longer it simmers, the more the flavors will meld and intensify, so feel free to let it go for an hour or even longer. If the chili becomes too thick during cooking, add more beef broth to reach your desired consistency.</p><h3 id=step-7-taste-and-adjust-seasoning>Step 7: Taste and Adjust Seasoning</h3><p>Before serving, taste the chili and adjust the seasoning as necessary. You can add more salt, pepper, or chili powder to taste. If you like your chili spicier, this is the time to add extra hot sauce or some crushed red pepper flakes.</p><h3 id=step-8-serve-and-garnish>Step 8: Serve and Garnish</h3><p>Once the chili has simmered to perfection, it’s ready to serve. Ladle it into bowls and top with your favorite garnishes, such as a dollop of sour cream, a handful of shredded cheese, fresh green onions, and chopped cilantro. You can also serve it with tortilla chips or cornbread on the side for an added crunch.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-perfect-beef-chili>Tips for the Perfect Beef Chili</h2><ul><li><strong>Use the right cut of beef</strong>: While ground beef is the classic choice, you can also use beef chuck that has been chopped into small pieces for an even richer texture. The fat content in the beef contributes significantly to the flavor, so don’t skimp on the fat.</li><li><strong>Let it simmer</strong>: The longer you let your chili simmer, the more flavor it will develop. A slow simmer allows the spices to infuse the broth, creating a deeper, more complex flavor profile.</li><li><strong>Customize the heat</strong>: Adjust the level of spiciness by increasing or decreasing the amount of jalapeños, chili powder, and hot sauce. You can also experiment with different types of chili peppers to change the flavor.</li><li><strong>Make it a one-pot meal</strong>: If you want a more filling chili, you can add additional vegetables like carrots, zucchini, or corn to the pot. These vegetables will add extra texture and sweetness, balancing out the spiciness.</li><li><strong>Prepare ahead</strong>: Chili is even better the next day as the flavors continue to meld together. You can make it ahead of time and store it in the fridge for up to three days, or freeze it for up to three months. Just reheat on the stovetop, adding more broth if needed.</li></ul><h2 id=variations-of-beef-chili>Variations of Beef Chili</h2><p>While this hearty beef chili recipe is delicious on its own, it’s also very versatile. Here are a few ways you can customize it to suit your tastes:</p><h3 id=1-vegetarian-chili>1. <strong>Vegetarian Chili</strong></h3><p>For a vegetarian version of this chili, simply omit the beef and add more beans (such as pinto beans or chickpeas) and vegetables. You can also use plant-based ground meat alternatives to mimic the texture of beef.</p><h3 id=2-spicy-chili>2. <strong>Spicy Chili</strong></h3><p>If you’re a fan of heat, ramp up the spiciness with extra chili powder, a variety of fresh peppers, or even a couple of tablespoons of chipotle in adobo sauce. The smoky chipotle will add depth while increasing the heat.</p><h3 id=3-slow-cooker-chili>3. <strong>Slow Cooker Chili</strong></h3><p>To make this recipe in a slow cooker, brown the beef and sauté the vegetables in a skillet first. Then, transfer everything to the slow cooker, including all the spices, beans, tomatoes, and broth. Cook on low for 6-8 hours or high for 3-4 hours. The slow cooker method allows the flavors to develop even further, and you’ll have a hands-off meal ready by dinnertime.</p><h2 id=why-this-hearty-beef-chili-is-perfect-for-cold-nights>Why This Hearty Beef Chili Is Perfect for Cold Nights</h2><p>There’s something incredibly comforting about a warm bowl of chili on a cold night.
