The dish as we know it today likely evolved in the United States, with Southern and Midwestern influences playing a significant role. The combination of a hearty chicken stew with soft, pillowy dumplings quickly became a comfort food favorite, particularly in the colder months when warmth and richness were needed most.</p><p>Like many classic dishes, chicken and dumplings can vary by region and family traditions. Some prefer a thicker, creamy base, while others lean towards a lighter, broth-based soup. Regardless of the version, the essential elements remain the same: tender chicken, flavorful broth, and dumplings that add both texture and substance to the meal.</p><h2 id=what-youll-need-ingredients-for-chicken-and-dumplings>What You’ll Need: Ingredients for Chicken and Dumplings</h2><p>To make this recipe, you’ll need a few simple ingredients, most of which you likely already have in your kitchen.

Making old-fashioned chicken and dumplings requires a few steps, but don’t worry—it’s relatively simple and well worth the effort. The key is taking your time to build up rich flavors and ensuring your dumplings are soft, fluffy, and perfectly cooked.</p><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-chicken-and-broth>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken and Broth</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re using a whole chicken, start by cutting it into pieces to make it easier to cook. Place the chicken in a large pot and cover it with water, ensuring there&rsquo;s enough liquid to fully submerge the bird. Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to a simmer and cook the chicken for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until it&rsquo;s fully cooked and tender.</p><p>For a quicker method, you can skip this step and use pre-cooked chicken or bone-in chicken thighs. In this case, cook the chicken directly in the broth.</p><p>While your chicken is cooking, heat a separate pot over medium heat, and add the olive oil or butter. Sauté the chopped onion, carrots, and celery for about 5-7 minutes, until they start to soften. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute, until fragrant. Once the vegetables are softened, add the chicken broth to the pot and bring it to a simmer. If you have leftover chicken stock, this will add an extra depth of flavor. Stir in the bay leaves, thyme, and rosemary. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p><h3 id=step-2-shred-the-chicken>Step 2: Shred the Chicken</h3><p>Once your chicken is fully cooked, remove it from the pot and allow it to cool slightly. When cool enough to handle, shred the meat from the bones using two forks. Discard the bones and skin. You’ll want to reserve the chicken meat for the soup. If you’re using pre-cooked chicken, simply shred it and add it directly to the pot.</p><p>Once shredded, add the chicken back to the broth and vegetable mixture, allowing it to warm through and absorb some of the flavors. At this point, the broth should be rich and flavorful, and the chicken should be tender.</p><h3 id=step-3-prepare-the-dumplings>Step 3: Prepare the Dumplings</h3><p>While your chicken is simmering in the broth, it’s time to prepare the dumplings. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar (if using). Stir to combine the dry ingredients. In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, and melted butter until fully combined. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until just combined—don’t overwork the dough, as this can make the dumplings dense. The dough should be thick but still soft and sticky.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-the-dumplings-to-the-soup>Step 4: Add the Dumplings to the Soup</h3><p>Once the broth is simmering, it’s time to add the dumplings. Spoon the dumpling dough into the pot in small, rounded dollops, making sure to space them out evenly in the pot. The dumplings will puff up as they cook, so be sure to leave some space between them.</p><p>Cover the pot with a lid, reduce the heat to low, and allow the dumplings to steam in the broth for about 15-20 minutes. Avoid lifting the lid while they cook, as the steam is crucial for the dumplings to cook through. The dumplings should be fluffy and slightly golden when done. You can check their doneness by inserting a toothpick or fork into the center of one—if it comes out clean, they’re ready.</p><h3 id=step-5-finishing-touches>Step 5: Finishing Touches</h3><p>Once the dumplings are cooked, taste the broth for seasoning. Add more salt, pepper, or herbs if needed. Garnish with fresh parsley or thyme to add a pop of color and extra freshness.</p><h3 id=step-6-serve-and-enjoy>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Ladle the chicken and dumplings into bowls and serve immediately. This dish is perfect for pairing with a side of crusty bread or a simple salad. The rich broth, tender chicken, and fluffy dumplings combine to make a satisfying and hearty meal. Whether you’re feeding your family or serving guests, this dish is sure to be a crowd-pleaser.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-chicken-and-dumplings>Tips for Perfect Chicken and Dumplings</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Use bone-in chicken for richer flavor</strong>: Bone-in chicken thighs or a whole chicken will give your broth a deeper, more robust flavor. If you prefer white meat, you can use chicken breasts, but the broth won’t have as much depth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t overmix the dumpling dough</strong>: Overmixing can result in tough, dense dumplings. Mix the ingredients until they just come together for the best texture.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adjust the broth thickness</strong>: If you prefer a thicker broth, you can make a slurry with a little cornstarch and water and add it to the soup before adding the dumplings. For a lighter broth, simply leave it as is.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customize your veggies</strong>: Feel free to add other vegetables like peas, corn, or green beans for extra flavor and texture. They can be added to the soup along with the chicken.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it a meal prep wonder</strong>: This dish keeps well in the fridge for a few days, and the flavors continue to develop as it sits. You can also freeze the soup (without the dumplings) for up to three months. When ready to serve, reheat the soup and make a fresh batch of dumplings.</p></li></ul><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Old-fashioned chicken and dumplings are the ultimate comfort food, offering warmth, flavor, and nostalgia in every bite. With tender chicken, a rich broth, and light, fluffy dumplings, this dish is a true crowd-pleaser. Whether you’re making it for a family dinner, special occasion, or simply to enjoy a cozy night in, chicken and dumplings will never go out of style.</p><p>By following these easy steps and tips, you’ll be able to create a hearty and flavorful meal that tastes just like it came straight from your grandmother’s kitchen. So gather your ingredients, roll up your sleeves, and enjoy the timeless magic of chicken and dumplings!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/categories/american-classics/>American Classics</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/old-fashioned-buttermilk-biscuit-recipe-for-brunch-delight/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Old-Fashioned Buttermilk Biscuit Recipe for Brunch Delight</span>
