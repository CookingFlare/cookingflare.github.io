Known for its fresh ingredients and bold flavors, chimichurri is traditionally used as a marinade or sauce for grilled meats, especially steak. Whether you&rsquo;re looking to enhance the flavor of your grilled foods or want to add a zesty twist to vegetables or even pasta, chimichurri sauce is the perfect addition to your culinary repertoire.</p><p>In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to make a simple and delicious chimichurri sauce from scratch. You won’t need any fancy equipment or complicated techniques—just a few basic ingredients, a knife, and a bowl to bring this sauce to life. Let&rsquo;s dive into the world of chimichurri and unlock its delicious possibilities!</p><h2 id=what-is-chimichurri-sauce>What is Chimichurri Sauce?</h2><p>Chimichurri is an uncooked sauce made with fresh herbs, garlic, vinegar, oil, and spices. It’s known for its herbal brightness and tangy flavor profile, making it an ideal accompaniment to grilled meats, roasted vegetables, and even as a topping for sandwiches or salads.</p><p>While chimichurri has its roots in Argentina, many countries in South America and beyond have made their own variations of this sauce. However, the classic Argentine chimichurri typically consists of parsley, garlic, red wine vinegar, and olive oil as the core ingredients. Some versions may include oregano, chili flakes, lemon juice, or shallots to enhance the flavor, but the basic foundation remains consistent.</p><h3 id=ingredients-for-classic-chimichurri-sauce>Ingredients for Classic Chimichurri Sauce</h3><p>To make a classic chimichurri sauce at home, you will need the following ingredients:</p><ul><li><strong>Fresh Parsley (1 cup, packed)</strong> – Parsley is the star of the show. Choose flat-leaf parsley for its vibrant, slightly peppery flavor that will dominate the sauce.</li><li><strong>Garlic (4-5 cloves)</strong> – Garlic adds a sharp, aromatic punch to the sauce, balancing the freshness of the herbs.</li><li><strong>Red Wine Vinegar (2-3 tablespoons)</strong> – Red wine vinegar offers acidity that complements the richness of the olive oil and provides a tangy kick.</li><li><strong>Olive Oil (½ cup)</strong> – Use high-quality extra virgin olive oil for the best flavor. The oil brings the sauce together, creating a smooth consistency and rich mouthfeel.</li><li><strong>Dried Oregano (1 teaspoon)</strong> – Oregano is commonly added to chimichurri for depth and an earthy flavor.</li><li><strong>Crushed Red Pepper Flakes (½ teaspoon)</strong> – For a hint of spice, red pepper flakes add a gentle heat that balances out the other ingredients.</li><li><strong>Salt and Black Pepper</strong> – These seasoning elements bring out the flavors of the sauce and help to enhance its overall profile.</li></ul><p>You can adjust the quantities based on your taste preferences. Some people enjoy a spicier chimichurri with more red pepper flakes, while others prefer to keep it milder. Experiment with the proportions to make the sauce your own!</p><h2 id=step-by-step-guide-to-making-chimichurri-sauce>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Chimichurri Sauce</h2><h3 id=1-prepare-the-fresh-herbs>1. Prepare the Fresh Herbs</h3><p>The key to a great chimichurri is using fresh, vibrant herbs. Start by washing the parsley thoroughly and drying it completely. Fresh herbs will help create a more aromatic and flavorful sauce. Once dry, chop the parsley finely. You want the pieces small enough to incorporate easily into the sauce, but not so finely chopped that they turn into a paste. Rough chopping is ideal for the desired texture.</p><h3 id=2-mince-the-garlic>2. Mince the Garlic</h3><p>Next, take your garlic cloves and mince them finely. Garlic adds a sharp, intense flavor to the chimichurri, so it&rsquo;s important to chop it into small pieces to ensure it distributes evenly throughout the sauce. If you want a smoother texture, you can crush the garlic using the side of a knife, then chop it.</p><h3 id=3-combine-the-dry-ingredients>3. Combine the Dry Ingredients</h3><p>In a medium-sized bowl, add your finely chopped parsley, minced garlic, dried oregano, crushed red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper. Mix these dry ingredients together to combine them thoroughly.</p><h3 id=4-add-the-vinegar-and-olive-oil>4. Add the Vinegar and Olive Oil</h3><p>Once the dry ingredients are well mixed, it&rsquo;s time to add the liquids. Pour in the red wine vinegar, which will provide the tangy base of the sauce, and then drizzle in the olive oil. The oil should be added slowly to create a smooth sauce that coats the herbs. Stir the mixture well to incorporate all the ingredients.</p><h3 id=5-adjust-to-taste>5. Adjust to Taste</h3><p>At this stage, take a moment to taste the chimichurri. Do you want more acidity? Add a touch more vinegar. Want a spicier version? Throw in a little extra crushed red pepper flakes. Season with additional salt and black pepper as needed to bring out the flavors. The beauty of chimichurri lies in its flexibility, so feel free to adjust it to your liking.</p><h3 id=6-let-it-rest>6. Let It Rest</h3><p>Once the chimichurri is mixed and seasoned to your satisfaction, let it rest for at least 10-15 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. While chimichurri can be used immediately, resting it helps the ingredients blend and develop a deeper flavor. If you have time, you can even prepare the sauce a few hours in advance—or even the day before—to allow the flavors to fully infuse.</p><h3 id=7-serve-and-enjoy>7. Serve and Enjoy!</h3><p>Now that your chimichurri is ready, it&rsquo;s time to serve it! Pour the sauce over grilled meats such as steak, chicken, or lamb, or use it as a topping for roasted vegetables. Chimichurri is incredibly versatile and can be used as a marinade, dipping sauce, or even a salad dressing.</p><h2 id=variations-on-chimichurri-sauce>Variations on Chimichurri Sauce</h2><p>While the classic chimichurri recipe is simple and easy to make, there are a few variations you can try depending on your taste preferences. Here are some ideas to get you started:</p><h3 id=1-lemon-chimichurri>1. <strong>Lemon Chimichurri</strong></h3><p>For an extra burst of freshness, you can swap the red wine vinegar with fresh lemon juice. The lemon will add a more citrusy flavor, making the chimichurri even more zesty and vibrant. You can also add lemon zest for a hint of aromatic citrus.</p><h3 id=2-cilantro-chimichurri>2. <strong>Cilantro Chimichurri</strong></h3><p>Cilantro lovers can swap out the parsley for cilantro for a completely different flavor profile. This version will have a more herbal and citrusy kick. It&rsquo;s perfect for dishes that pair well with cilantro, such as grilled fish or tacos.</p><h3 id=3-smoky-chimichurri>3. <strong>Smoky Chimichurri</strong></h3><p>If you prefer a smoky undertone in your chimichurri, you can add smoked paprika or chipotle chili powder. These spices will bring a subtle smoky flavor that adds depth to the sauce, making it perfect for grilled meats and hearty dishes.</p><h3 id=4-tomato-chimichurri>4. <strong>Tomato Chimichurri</strong></h3><p>For a more substantial version of chimichurri, try adding finely chopped tomatoes. The tomatoes will add juiciness and a slight sweetness that complements the acidity of the vinegar and the freshness of the herbs. This variation is excellent as a topping for grilled vegetables or roasted meats.</p><h3 id=5-spicy-chimichurri>5. <strong>Spicy Chimichurri</strong></h3><p>To give your chimichurri a more intense heat, add fresh jalapeño or habanero peppers. Mince the peppers and incorporate them into the sauce along with the garlic. This spicy chimichurri is perfect for those who love a bit of kick with their meals.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-best-chimichurri-sauce>Tips for the Best Chimichurri Sauce</h2><ul><li><strong>Use Fresh Herbs:</strong> The fresher the herbs, the better the sauce will taste. Avoid using dried parsley for a more vibrant, aromatic chimichurri.</li><li><strong>Quality Olive Oil:</strong> Since olive oil makes up a significant portion of the sauce, use a high-quality extra virgin olive oil to achieve the best flavor.</li><li><strong>Don’t Overmix:</strong> You want the sauce to have a little texture, so avoid pureeing or over-mixing the ingredients. The herbs should still be recognizable and provide a rustic feel to the sauce.</li><li><strong>Rest Before Serving:</strong> Letting the chimichurri sit for at least 10-15 minutes helps the flavors meld together, but it also keeps the fresh, bright notes of the herbs intact.</li></ul><h2 id=storing-chimichurri-sauce>Storing Chimichurri Sauce</h2><p>If you have any leftover chimichurri sauce, you can store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-5 days. Over time, the flavors will continue to develop and improve, making it even tastier. Chimichurri can also be frozen if you want to make a larger batch. Simply transfer the sauce to a freezer-safe container and store it for up to 3 months. When you&rsquo;re ready to use it, let it thaw in the fridge overnight and give it a good stir before serving.</p><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Making chimichurri sauce at home is an easy and rewarding way to elevate your meals.
