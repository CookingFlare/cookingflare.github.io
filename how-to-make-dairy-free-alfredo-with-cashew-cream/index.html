The good news is that making a rich, creamy, and delicious dairy-free Alfredo sauce is easier than you might think! In this blog post, we’re going to teach you how to make a creamy, velvety Dairy-Free Alfredo with Cashew Cream – a vegan alternative that’s just as decadent and satisfying as the original.</p><h3 id=why-cashew-cream>Why Cashew Cream?</h3><p>The base of this dairy-free Alfredo sauce is cashew cream, which is made by blending raw cashews with water to create a smooth, creamy texture. Cashews are naturally rich in fats and proteins, which makes them an excellent substitute for dairy in creamy sauces. Cashew cream provides a neutral, mild flavor that absorbs the seasonings beautifully, giving you the creamy richness that Alfredo is known for.</p><p>Aside from being a fantastic dairy-free option, cashew cream is also an excellent source of magnesium, healthy fats, and antioxidants, making it a nutritious alternative to dairy-based creams.</p><h3 id=ingredients>Ingredients</h3><p>Here’s a simple list of ingredients you’ll need to make this Dairy-Free Alfredo Sauce with Cashew Cream:</p><h4 id=for-the-cashew-cream>For the Cashew Cream:</h4><ul><li>1 cup raw cashews (soaked for at least 4 hours or overnight)</li><li>1/2 cup water (more if needed for consistency)</li><li>1 tsp lemon juice (optional, for brightness)</li></ul><h4 id=for-the-alfredo-sauce>For the Alfredo Sauce:</h4><ul><li>1 tbsp olive oil (or any neutral oil)</li><li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>1 1/2 cups unsweetened almond milk (or any dairy-free milk of your choice)</li><li>1/2 cup vegetable broth (or more for thinning if needed)</li><li>1/2 tsp salt (or to taste)</li><li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper (or to taste)</li><li>1/4 tsp ground nutmeg (optional, for depth of flavor)</li><li>1/4 cup nutritional yeast (for that cheesy flavor)</li><li>2 tbsp cornstarch or arrowroot powder (for thickening)</li><li>1 tbsp fresh parsley (chopped, for garnish)</li><li>Fresh pasta of your choice (gluten-free, whole wheat, or regular)</li></ul><h3 id=how-to-make-dairy-free-alfredo-with-cashew-cream>How to Make Dairy-Free Alfredo with Cashew Cream</h3><h4 id=step-1-soak-the-cashews>Step 1: Soak the Cashews</h4><p>The first step is preparing the cashew cream. Raw cashews need to be soaked in water for at least 4 hours or overnight, so plan ahead! If you’re short on time, you can speed up the process by boiling the cashews for about 10 minutes. Once the cashews are soft, drain them and set them aside.</p><h4 id=step-2-make-the-cashew-cream>Step 2: Make the Cashew Cream</h4><p>Now it’s time to make the creamy base. In a high-speed blender or food processor, add the soaked cashews, 1/2 cup of water, and the lemon juice (if using). Blend until the mixture becomes smooth and creamy. If the consistency is too thick, you can add more water, a tablespoon at a time, until you achieve a thick but pourable consistency. Set the cashew cream aside – you’ll be adding it to the Alfredo sauce later.</p><h4 id=step-3-prepare-the-alfredo-sauce>Step 3: Prepare the Alfredo Sauce</h4><p>In a large saucepan or skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1-2 minutes until it becomes fragrant and golden brown. Be careful not to burn the garlic, as it can turn bitter quickly.</p><p>Once the garlic is ready, add in the unsweetened almond milk and vegetable broth. Stir to combine and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Let it cook for about 5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p><h4 id=step-4-thicken-the-sauce>Step 4: Thicken the Sauce</h4><p>To give the Alfredo sauce the right consistency, you’ll need to thicken it. In a small bowl, mix the cornstarch (or arrowroot powder) with a tablespoon of water to create a slurry. Slowly pour the slurry into the simmering sauce, stirring constantly. This will help thicken the sauce to a creamy, smooth texture. If the sauce is too thick, feel free to add a little more vegetable broth or almond milk to reach your desired consistency.</p><h4 id=step-5-add-the-cashew-cream-and-seasonings>Step 5: Add the Cashew Cream and Seasonings</h4><p>Once the sauce has thickened to your liking, it’s time to stir in the cashew cream. Add the cashew cream to the sauce and stir well to combine. You’ll notice the sauce immediately becoming rich and creamy, just like traditional Alfredo.</p><p>Next, season the sauce with salt, pepper, and optional ground nutmeg. If you like a cheesy flavor, sprinkle in the nutritional yeast. Stir everything together and let the sauce simmer for another 3-4 minutes to ensure everything is heated through and well combined.</p><h4 id=step-6-combine-with-pasta>Step 6: Combine with Pasta</h4><p>While the sauce is simmering, cook your favorite pasta according to package instructions. You can use gluten-free pasta if needed, or any type of pasta that you love, from spaghetti to fettuccine to penne.</p><p>Once the pasta is cooked and drained, add it directly to the Alfredo sauce. Toss the pasta in the creamy sauce, making sure every noodle is coated in the velvety goodness.</p><h4 id=step-7-serve-and-garnish>Step 7: Serve and Garnish</h4><p>Serve your Dairy-Free Alfredo immediately, garnishing with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color and a fresh herbal note. For an extra indulgent touch, sprinkle some additional nutritional yeast on top for a cheesy flavor or a light drizzle of olive oil for richness.</p><h3 id=tips-for-the-perfect-dairy-free-alfredo-sauce>Tips for the Perfect Dairy-Free Alfredo Sauce</h3><ul><li><strong>Soaking the Cashews</strong>: Soaking the cashews is crucial for achieving a smooth and creamy texture.

If you don’t have it on hand, you can leave it out, but the flavor might be slightly different.</li><li><strong>Thickening the Sauce</strong>: If you don’t have cornstarch, you can use arrowroot powder or even flour as a thickening agent. However, be mindful of the amount of liquid you add as you work through thickening the sauce, as too much liquid can make the sauce too runny.</li><li><strong>Add Veggies</strong>: Feel free to add vegetables like sautéed spinach, mushrooms, or roasted broccoli to this dish to enhance both flavor and nutrition.</li><li><strong>Storage</strong>: This Dairy-Free Alfredo sauce stores well in the fridge for up to 4 days.

You can also toss in some extra garlic for a more intense flavor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mushroom Alfredo</strong>: For a heartier dish, sauté some sliced mushrooms along with the garlic and incorporate them into the sauce.
