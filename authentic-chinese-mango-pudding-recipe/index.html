This creamy and smooth dessert is bursting with the natural sweetness of ripe mangoes, offering a refreshing conclusion to a hearty meal. Whether you&rsquo;re preparing for a special occasion or simply want to indulge in a fruity treat, this authentic Chinese mango pudding recipe is sure to satisfy your cravings.</p><h3 id=what-is-mango-pudding>What is Mango Pudding?</h3><p>Mango pudding is a sweet, velvety dessert that combines mango puree with a gelatinous or custard-like consistency. Popular in Cantonese cuisine, it’s often served at the end of a meal in Chinese restaurants, particularly dim sum establishments. The bright yellow hue and tropical flavor make it an irresistible choice, and it’s an easy-to-make dish that requires only a few ingredients.</p><p>Unlike the Western version of mango mousse, Chinese mango pudding has a thicker texture, often achieved through the use of gelatin or agar-agar, giving it a custard-like consistency. The base of the pudding usually includes fresh mangoes, coconut milk, sugar, and a setting agent. The best part? It’s a no-bake dessert, which means it’s quick to prepare and can be made ahead of time!</p><h3 id=ingredients-for-authentic-chinese-mango-pudding>Ingredients for Authentic Chinese Mango Pudding</h3><p>To make a truly authentic Chinese mango pudding, fresh mangoes are essential. It’s important to choose ripe, sweet mangoes for the best flavor. Here’s what you’ll need for this delicious dessert:</p><ul><li><strong>2 large ripe mangoes</strong> (about 450g to 500g)</li><li><strong>1/2 cup coconut milk</strong> (full-fat or light, depending on your preference)</li><li><strong>1/4 cup sugar</strong> (adjust to taste, depending on the sweetness of your mangoes)</li><li><strong>1/2 cup water</strong></li><li><strong>2 teaspoons agar-agar powder</strong> (or gelatin if you prefer)</li><li><strong>2 tablespoons milk</strong> (whole milk or dairy-free alternatives)</li><li><strong>A pinch of salt</strong> (to balance sweetness)</li><li><strong>Optional garnishes:</strong> Fresh mango cubes, whipped cream, or coconut flakes for decoration</li></ul><h3 id=step-by-step-guide-to-making-mango-pudding>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Mango Pudding</h3><p>Now, let&rsquo;s walk through the steps to create this velvety, tropical dessert. The process is simple and doesn&rsquo;t require advanced cooking skills, making it a perfect option for beginner cooks and experienced chefs alike.</p><h4 id=1-prepare-the-mangoes>1. Prepare the Mangoes</h4><p>Start by peeling the mangoes and cutting them into small cubes. Discard the pit and any tough fibers. Place the mango cubes in a blender or food processor and blend them into a smooth puree. Depending on the size of your mangoes, you should have about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of mango puree. Set aside for later use.</p><h4 id=2-dissolve-the-agar-agar>2. Dissolve the Agar-Agar</h4><p>Agar-agar is a plant-based gelling agent, which is commonly used in Asian desserts. If you&rsquo;re using gelatin instead, the process will be slightly different, but the result will be the same.</p><p>In a small saucepan, combine the agar-agar powder with 1/2 cup of water. Stir gently, and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 3-4 minutes, or until the agar-agar is completely dissolved. Be sure to stir constantly to prevent any lumps from forming. Once dissolved, remove from heat and let it cool slightly.</p><h4 id=3-combine-the-mango-puree-and-coconut-milk>3. Combine the Mango Puree and Coconut Milk</h4><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the freshly made mango puree with the coconut milk, sugar, and a pinch of salt. Stir the mixture until the sugar is dissolved. The coconut milk adds a rich, creamy texture that enhances the tropical flavor of the mangoes, making it an essential ingredient in this dish.</p><h4 id=4-add-the-agar-agar-mixture>4. Add the Agar-Agar Mixture</h4><p>Slowly pour the dissolved agar-agar mixture into the mango-coconut mixture. Stir well to ensure that the agar-agar is evenly incorporated. The warm agar-agar will help everything blend together smoothly. At this point, you should have a creamy, slightly runny mixture that will thicken as it cools.</p><h4 id=5-pour-into-molds>5. Pour into Molds</h4><p>Now, it’s time to transfer the mango mixture into your desired molds. You can use small individual molds, a large baking dish, or even silicone molds for fun shapes. If you&rsquo;re planning to serve the pudding in a more elegant way, small glass cups or bowls work wonderfully as well. Make sure to leave a little space at the top of each mold for easy removal later.</p><h4 id=6-let-it-set>6. Let it Set</h4><p>Once you&rsquo;ve poured the mixture into your molds, place them in the refrigerator to set. Allow the mango pudding to chill for at least 4 hours, or until it has completely firmed up. This step is essential for achieving that perfect, pudding-like texture. If you&rsquo;re in a rush, you can also speed up the process by placing the molds in the freezer for 1-2 hours.</p><h4 id=7-serve-and-garnish>7. Serve and Garnish</h4><p>Once the pudding has fully set, remove it from the fridge. If you used silicone molds or cups, gently run a knife around the edges of the pudding to help release it from the mold. You can invert the molds onto a plate or serve them directly in the bowls. For an extra touch of elegance, top your mango pudding with fresh mango cubes, whipped cream, or even a sprinkle of toasted coconut flakes.</p><h3 id=tips-for-the-perfect-mango-pudding>Tips for the Perfect Mango Pudding</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Choose Ripe Mangoes</strong>: The sweetness and flavor of your mango pudding depend on the quality of the mangoes. Make sure your mangoes are fully ripe, soft to the touch, and bursting with flavor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adjust Sweetness</strong>: If your mangoes are extra sweet, feel free to reduce the sugar amount. If they’re less ripe, you may want to increase the sugar a little to balance the tartness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vegan Option</strong>: To make a vegan version, simply substitute the milk and coconut milk for plant-based alternatives like almond milk or oat milk. Agar-agar is already vegan-friendly, so this substitution will work perfectly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it Ahead</strong>: Mango pudding is a fantastic dessert to prepare in advance. You can make it a day or two ahead of time and store it in the refrigerator until you’re ready to serve.</p></li><li><p><strong>Texture Variations</strong>: If you prefer a smoother, creamier texture, you can increase the amount of coconut milk or use full-fat coconut milk. If you want the pudding to have a firmer texture, slightly increase the agar-agar amount.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fresh Mango Topping</strong>: For an added burst of mango flavor, use fresh mango cubes as a topping right before serving. This adds a fresh and juicy contrast to the creamy pudding.</p></li></ol><h3 id=why-is-mango-pudding-so-popular>Why is Mango Pudding So Popular?</h3><p>Mango pudding is more than just a dessert—it’s a cultural icon in Chinese cuisine.

Whether it&rsquo;s a Chinese New Year gathering or a casual family dinner, mango pudding adds a touch of elegance to any table.</p><h3 id=variations-of-mango-pudding>Variations of Mango Pudding</h3><p>While the basic recipe for mango pudding is quite simple, there are many ways you can personalize it to suit your tastes or dietary preferences.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Mango Coconut Pudding</strong>: For those who love the tropical combination of mango and coconut, adding extra coconut milk or even shredded coconut to the pudding base will deepen the flavor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mango Agar-Agar Bars</strong>: If you prefer a firmer version of the pudding that’s easier to slice and serve, you can increase the amount of agar-agar and pour the mixture into a large baking dish, allowing it to set into bars.</p></li><li><p><strong>Mango Lassi-Inspired Pudding</strong>: For a tangy twist, try adding a bit of yogurt to the pudding mix, which will give it a flavor reminiscent of mango lassi, the popular Indian yogurt-based drink.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tropical Fruit Salad Pudding</strong>: Serve the mango pudding with an assortment of tropical fruits, such as papaya, pineapple, and kiwi, to create a fresh fruit salad that complements the sweetness of the pudding.</p></li></ol><h3 id=health-benefits-of-mangoes-in-pudding>Health Benefits of Mangoes in Pudding</h3><p>Apart from being delicious, mangoes offer numerous health benefits.
