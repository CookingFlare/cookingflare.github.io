History of Falafels
Falafel's origins are murky, but one story goes that they were born from a peasant food made by reusing fava beans during periods of poverty in Egypt. They quickly became a social hub centerpiece, people gathering around long planks to serve the deceptive pocket meat since it was generally shut tight well so all could get food efficiently instead of them laying there getting soggy with anyone. In the past years, Tahini's and chilies flavored Middle Eastern sauces created within its convenience hybrid with professional engaging brill variations. Clearly, it adapts and might well develop to illustrate all appropriately.

Easy Mediterranean Baked Falafel Sandwiches: A Flavorful and Convenient Twist on a Classic Dish
The Mediterranean diet has long been known for its emphasis on whole grains, fresh vegetables, and lean protein sources, leading to long and healthy lives. One beloved Mediterranean staple is the humble falafel, a crispy, flavorful little ball of goodness that peppers the streets of countries like Lebanon, Egypt, and Greece. In this recipe, we'll show you how to turn the classic street food into a brilliant and easy-to-make sandwich, stuffed with crunchy texture and vibrant flavors, perfect for a quick mid-week meal or a spontaneous gathering with friends.
History of Falafels
Falafel's origins are murky, but one story goes that they were born from a peasant food made by reusing fava beans during periods of poverty in Egypt. They quickly became a social hub centerpiece, bringing people together around long planks to enjoy the nutrient-rich, spicy little treats.
Make the Falafel
Making the crunchy baked falafel for this Mediterranean sandwich begins with a few simple ingredients and a bit of preparation.
Ingredients:</p><p>1 cup dried fava beans or 2 cups dried chickpeas that have been pre-soaked
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves of garlic, minced
1 cup chopped fresh parsley
1/4 cup chopped fresh mint
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 eggs</p><p>Instructions:</p><p>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
In a large bowl, mash the fava beans or chickpeas using a fork or a potato masher until they're coarsely chopped.
In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, onion, garlic, parsley, mint, cilantro, lemon juice, olive oil, cumin, smoked paprika (if using), salt, and black pepper.
Add the dry ingredients to the soaked and mashed fava beans or chickpeas and mix until well combined.
Beat in the eggs until the mixture is smooth.
Using your hands, shape the mixture into small patties or balls, about 1 1/2 inches (3.8 cm) in diameter and 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) thick.
Place the patties or balls onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between each piece.</p><p>Bake the Falafel</p><p>Bake the falafel for 20-25 minutes or until they're golden brown and crispy on the outside and cooked through.
Remove the falafel from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving.</p><p>Assemble the Sandwich</p><p>Warm pita bread by wrapping it in a damp paper towel and microwaving for 20-30 seconds or toasting it in a toaster.
Split the pita bread in half lengthwise.
Spread a layer of tzatziki sauce or tahini on the bottom half of the pita bread.
Place a few falafel patties or balls on the sauce.
Add sliced cucumber, tomato, onion, and pickled turnips (optional).
Top with the top half of the pita bread.</p><p>Tips and Variations</p><p>For crispy falafel, bake them at 450°F (230°C) for the first 5-7 minutes, then reduce the heat to 400°F (200°C) and continue baking for the remaining time.
To make gluten-free falafel, replace the all-purpose flour with gluten-free flour or almond flour.
For vegan falafel, replace the eggs with a flax egg or omit them altogether.
To make ahead, store the falafel in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 2 months.</p><p>Enjoy your delicious Mediterranean baked falafel sandwiches, perfect for a quick and satisfying meal or snack!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/categories/mediterranean-cuisine/>Mediterranean Cuisine</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/easy-hummus-recipe-a-mediterranean-staple/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Easy Hummus Recipe: A Mediterranean Staple</span>
