Between work, errands, and family commitments, it often feels like there are never enough hours in the day. But what if you could make fresh, warm rolls in a fraction of the time without compromising on taste? That’s where quick rolls come in! These easy-to-make rolls are perfect for busy weekdays, and they can be customized to suit any occasion.</p><p>Whether you’re looking for a quick side to accompany a dinner, a snack for the kids, or even a quick breakfast, these rolls will become your go-to recipe for convenience and flavor. In this post, we will guide you through the process of making soft, fluffy rolls in under an hour, using common ingredients and simple techniques.</p><h2 id=the-basics-of-quick-rolls>The Basics of Quick Rolls</h2><p>Before diving into the recipe, let’s take a moment to understand what makes quick rolls different from traditional rolls. The primary difference lies in the rising time. Traditional rolls often require multiple hours for the dough to rise, which is perfect for making rolls from scratch but isn’t always feasible during a busy day.</p><p>Quick rolls, on the other hand, use a faster method that cuts down the rise time significantly. This means you can still enjoy the homemade goodness of freshly baked rolls without the long wait. The trick is using baking powder or baking soda instead of yeast, which eliminates the need for the dough to rise for an extended period.</p><p>With that in mind, let’s dive into how you can make these quick rolls for your next busy weekday.</p><h2 id=ingredients-youll-need>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2><p>To make these quick rolls, you don’t need any fancy ingredients. Most of what you need can already be found in your pantry. Here’s a simple list of the ingredients:</p><ul><li>2 cups of all-purpose flour (for soft and fluffy rolls)</li><li>2 teaspoons of baking powder (the secret to quick leavening)</li><li>1/2 teaspoon of salt (for flavor)</li><li>2 tablespoons of sugar (optional, depending on how sweet you like your rolls)</li><li>1/2 cup of milk (whole milk or buttermilk for extra richness)</li><li>1/4 cup of unsalted butter (melted, for soft texture)</li><li>1 egg (optional, for an even richer flavor)</li><li>2 tablespoons of melted butter (for brushing the rolls after baking)</li></ul><h3 id=optional-ingredients-for-extra-flavor>Optional Ingredients for Extra Flavor:</h3><ul><li>Garlic powder, onion powder, or herbs (for savory rolls)</li><li>Cinnamon and sugar (for sweet rolls)</li><li>Shredded cheese (for cheesy rolls)</li></ul><p>Feel free to get creative with the flavorings! The beauty of these quick rolls is that they are highly adaptable to whatever flavor profile you want to achieve.</p><h2 id=step-by-step-instructions-to-make-quick-rolls>Step-by-Step Instructions to Make Quick Rolls</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-dry-ingredients>Step 1: Prepare the Dry Ingredients</h3><p>Start by preheating your oven to 375°F (190°C). While the oven heats up, grab a large mixing bowl and whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar (if using). The dry ingredients should be well-combined, ensuring that the baking powder is evenly distributed throughout the flour. This step is essential to ensure that your rolls rise evenly and have the desired fluffy texture.</p><h3 id=step-2-add-the-wet-ingredients>Step 2: Add the Wet Ingredients</h3><p>Next, create a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour the milk into the well, followed by the melted butter and the egg (if using). Mix everything together with a spoon or spatula until the dough starts to come together. The dough should be soft but not too sticky. If it’s too sticky, add a little more flour, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency.</p><h3 id=step-3-knead-the-dough>Step 3: Knead the Dough</h3><p>Once the dough has come together, transfer it to a lightly floured surface. Gently knead the dough for about 1 to 2 minutes. Since this is a quick roll recipe, you don’t need to knead for a long time—just enough to bring the dough together into a smooth, cohesive ball.</p><h3 id=step-4-shape-the-rolls>Step 4: Shape the Rolls</h3><p>After kneading, divide the dough into 8 equal portions (or more, if you prefer smaller rolls). Roll each portion into a ball and place them on a greased baking sheet, leaving a little space between each roll. If you’re making savory rolls, you can flatten the dough balls slightly to give them a more biscuit-like appearance.</p><h3 id=step-5-bake-the-rolls>Step 5: Bake the Rolls</h3><p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the rolls for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they are golden brown on top. Keep an eye on them during the last few minutes of baking, as they can brown quickly.</p><h3 id=step-6-brush-with-butter>Step 6: Brush with Butter</h3><p>Once the rolls are out of the oven, immediately brush them with the remaining melted butter. This step adds a glossy, delicious finish to the rolls and keeps them soft. Let the rolls rest for a few minutes before serving.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-quick-rolls-every-time>Tips for Perfect Quick Rolls Every Time</h2><ul><li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough:</strong> When mixing the dough, be sure not to overwork it. Overmixing can lead to dense rolls, so mix just until everything is combined.</li><li><strong>Adjust for Texture:</strong> If you like your rolls soft and tender, opt for whole milk and a little extra butter. For a slightly firmer roll, use skim milk and less butter.</li><li><strong>Add Flavorings:</strong> For savory rolls, try adding a teaspoon of garlic powder or herbs like rosemary, thyme, or oregano. For sweet rolls, consider adding cinnamon, nutmeg, or vanilla extract to the dough.</li><li><strong>Use Buttermilk:</strong> If you have buttermilk on hand, it can add an extra richness and tanginess to the rolls, making them even more flavorful.</li><li><strong>Shape Variations:</strong> You can shape the dough into rolls, but you can also experiment with making them into dinner biscuits or even drop biscuits, depending on the shape you prefer.</li><li><strong>Serving Ideas:</strong> These rolls pair beautifully with a variety of dishes, from soups and salads to roasted meats and stews. You can also serve them with butter, jam, or honey for a sweet treat.</li></ul><h2 id=why-quick-rolls-are-perfect-for-busy-weekdays>Why Quick Rolls Are Perfect for Busy Weekdays</h2><p>When it comes to quick meal prep, these rolls are a lifesaver. Here are a few reasons why they are ideal for busy weekdays:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Speed:</strong> From start to finish, these rolls only take around 30 to 40 minutes to make, including baking time.

Here are a few ideas:</p><h3 id=cheesy-garlic-rolls>Cheesy Garlic Rolls</h3><p>Add 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese into the dough and sprinkle some garlic powder on top before baking. This will result in a rich, savory roll that’s perfect to serve with pasta, pizza, or roasted vegetables.</p><h3 id=cinnamon-sugar-rolls>Cinnamon Sugar Rolls</h3><p>For a sweet treat, add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 2 tablespoons of sugar into the dough. After brushing the rolls with melted butter, sprinkle a mixture of cinnamon and sugar on top for a sweet, comforting flavor.</p><h3 id=herb-rolls>Herb Rolls</h3><p>If you love fresh herbs, mix in a tablespoon of finely chopped rosemary, thyme, or parsley to the dough. These herb rolls pair perfectly with roasted meats or as an accompaniment to a salad.</p><h3 id=whole-wheat-rolls>Whole Wheat Rolls</h3><p>To make these rolls healthier, substitute half of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour. The whole wheat flour adds a nutty flavor and a bit more fiber to the rolls, while still keeping them soft and tender.</p><h2 id=serving-suggestions-for-quick-rolls>Serving Suggestions for Quick Rolls</h2><p>These quick rolls are incredibly versatile and can be served in many different ways:</p><ul><li><p><strong>With Soups and Stews:</strong> A basket of warm rolls is the perfect accompaniment to a hearty bowl of soup or stew.
