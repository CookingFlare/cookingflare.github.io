The Flavors of North India
In North India, snacks are often associated with the rich, buttery tones of ghee and the bold flavors of spices. Take, for instance, the popular Golgappe, crispy puris puffed with a generous helping of spiced water, served with tamarind sauce. These flavorful fried dough puffs are a staple snack in North India, often enjoyed at street food stalls and parties. The capital city, Delhi, is famous for its Samosas, filling flaky pastry pockets with spiced potatoes, peas, and onions. Another popular snack, Kachoris, is deep-fried pastry puffs filled with spiced chickpeas or lentils, often served with a dollop of chilli-chutney.
Delhi's Street Food Stalls
But North India's street food scene is not just about the snacks; it's also about the way they're prepared and enjoyed. The largest wholesale market in Asia, the Chawri Bazaar in Old Delhi, boasts numerous street food stalls offering a variety of snacks, including mouthwatering Bhel Puri, a spicy street snack consisting of puffed rice, onions, tomatoes, and tamarind sauce. Another famous snack is Shikanji, a spicy drink made with the juice of oranges, lemons, and a hint of spices.
The Spice Route of the South
In South India, snacks take on a lighter, more delicate tone. The Uttapam, a rice and lentil pancake, is a popular snack often served with chutneys and sambar, a flavorful vegetable curry. Another delightful snack is Vada, a crispy fried lentil doughnut, coated and simmered in fermented toddy made from the sap of Palmyra palm trees. The South Indian favorite Idlis (also known as steamed rice cakes) are breaking up as popular use dough for dosas.
