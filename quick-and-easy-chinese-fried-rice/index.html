Below, we’ve broken down the process for you.</p><h3 id=step-1-prepare-your-ingredients>Step 1: Prepare Your Ingredients</h3><p>The key to perfect fried rice is having everything ready to go before you start cooking. Here’s how you should prep your ingredients:</p><ol><li><strong>Cook the rice:</strong> If you don’t have leftover rice, cook fresh rice and spread it out on a baking sheet to cool. This will help the rice dry out a little and prevent it from getting mushy when fried.</li><li><strong>Chop the vegetables:</strong> Finely chop the garlic, onion, and any vegetables you are using. If you&rsquo;re using frozen peas and carrots, you can defrost them in warm water for a few minutes or directly add them to the pan later.</li><li><strong>Prepare the protein (optional):</strong> If you’re using chicken, shrimp, or tofu, make sure it&rsquo;s cooked and cut into small pieces. You can also use pre-cooked leftovers to save time.</li><li><strong>Beat the eggs:</strong> Lightly beat the eggs in a bowl.</li></ol><h3 id=step-2-cook-the-eggs>Step 2: Cook the Eggs</h3><p>Start by heating a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once it’s hot, add about one tablespoon of vegetable oil. Pour in the beaten eggs, stirring gently to scramble. Cook them until just set, about 1-2 minutes, then remove them from the pan and set them aside. This keeps the eggs tender and prevents overcooking.</p><h3 id=step-3-sauté-the-aromatics>Step 3: Sauté the Aromatics</h3><p>In the same pan, add another tablespoon of vegetable oil. Turn the heat up to medium-high and add the chopped garlic and onion. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, or until fragrant and the onion becomes translucent. This is where you build the flavor base of your fried rice, so be sure to let the garlic infuse the oil.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-the-vegetables>Step 4: Add the Vegetables</h3><p>Next, add your mixed vegetables to the pan. If you&rsquo;re using frozen peas and carrots, these should go in next. Stir-fry for about 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are tender and fully heated through.</p><h3 id=step-5-fry-the-rice>Step 5: Fry the Rice</h3><p>Add the cold rice to the pan, breaking up any clumps with your spatula. Use day-old rice if you can, as it’s drier and less likely to become mushy when fried. Stir-fry the rice for 5-6 minutes, letting it lightly crisp and take on some golden brown spots. This will give your fried rice that signature texture and flavor.</p><h3 id=step-6-season-the-rice>Step 6: Season the Rice</h3><p>Once the rice is heated through and starting to get crispy, it&rsquo;s time to add the seasonings. Pour in the soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using), followed by the sesame oil. Stir everything together so the rice is evenly coated with the sauces. Add salt and pepper to taste. At this point, you can also add a little ginger or rice vinegar if you want to give your fried rice a bit of extra zing.</p><h3 id=step-7-add-the-eggs-and-protein-optional>Step 7: Add the Eggs and Protein (Optional)</h3><p>Return the scrambled eggs to the pan, breaking them up into small pieces. If you&rsquo;re using any protein (chicken, shrimp, or tofu), add it now as well. Mix everything together so the eggs and protein are evenly distributed throughout the rice. Continue stir-frying for another 2-3 minutes until everything is well incorporated and the rice is hot.</p><h3 id=step-8-garnish-and-serve>Step 8: Garnish and Serve</h3><p>Once everything is cooked and seasoned to your liking, it&rsquo;s time to serve! You can garnish your Chinese fried rice with freshly chopped green onions or cilantro for a burst of freshness. If you want a little extra crunch, sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds on top.</p><p>Serve the fried rice as a standalone meal or alongside your favorite Chinese dishes like Sweet and Sour Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, or a simple vegetable stir-fry.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-perfect-chinese-fried-rice>Tips for the Perfect Chinese Fried Rice</h2><p>While the recipe itself is straightforward, there are a few tips and tricks that can help you elevate your fried rice game:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Use Cold Rice:</strong> Freshly cooked rice tends to be too sticky and mushy when fried. For the best results, use rice that has been cooled and left in the fridge overnight. The grains firm up, which helps the fried rice maintain a better texture.</p></li><li><p><strong>High Heat is Key:</strong> Make sure your wok or skillet is hot before you add ingredients. Stir-frying on high heat is crucial to creating the slightly crispy, charred flavor that gives Chinese fried rice its signature taste.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t Overcrowd the Pan:</strong> If you’re making a large batch, consider cooking it in batches. Overcrowding the pan can make it difficult to achieve the desired texture and may result in steamed rice rather than crispy fried rice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add More Veggies:</strong> While peas and carrots are the traditional vegetables used in fried rice, feel free to add any veggies you have on hand, such as bell peppers, mushrooms, corn, or even leafy greens like spinach.</p></li><li><p><strong>Play with Protein:</strong> You can easily make fried rice with whatever protein you prefer. If you&rsquo;re using chicken, ensure it’s cooked through and cut into small pieces so it’s easy to stir into the rice. Shrimp and tofu are great alternatives if you&rsquo;re looking for a lighter or vegetarian option.</p></li><li><p><strong>Soy Sauce and Seasoning Adjustments:</strong> Depending on your taste, you can adjust the soy sauce and sesame oil to suit your preferences. If you like it saltier, add more soy sauce. For a more savory flavor, increase the sesame oil.</p></li><li><p><strong>Keep it Simple or Make it Fancy:</strong> While this recipe is quick and simple, feel free to add other flavorful ingredients like chili paste for heat or a splash of rice vinegar for tanginess. You can even top it off with a fried egg for an extra treat.</p></li></ol><h2 id=common-variations-of-chinese-fried-rice>Common Variations of Chinese Fried Rice</h2><p>Chinese fried rice is incredibly versatile, and you can customize it based on your dietary preferences or the ingredients available in your kitchen.

Tofu or tempeh can also be added as a protein source, making it a complete meal.</p><h3 id=4-egg-fried-rice>4. <strong>Egg Fried Rice</strong></h3><p>Egg fried rice is a basic version that focuses on the simplicity of scrambled eggs, soy sauce, and rice. It’s the most basic form of fried rice, but it’s still packed with flavor.</p><h3 id=5-bacon-fried-rice>5. <strong>Bacon Fried Rice</strong></h3><p>For a smoky twist, consider adding crispy bacon to your fried rice.
