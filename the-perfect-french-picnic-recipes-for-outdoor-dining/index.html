There's something charming about setting up a blanket, unpacking a wicker basket, and savoring the flavors of the season amidst the serenity of the great outdoors. To create the perfect French-inspired picnic, you'll want to focus on crafting a menu that's both elegant and easy to consume in a casual setting. Here, we'll guide you through a selection of recipes that will transport you to the rolling hills and charming villages of rural France.
Classic French Baguette Sandwiches
Begin with the bread, a staple of French cuisine. You can't go wrong with a classic baguette, and to elevate it to picnic-worthy standards, try making your own. The key is to keep it simple and let the flavors of the bread shine. To make a classic French baguette, you'll need:</p><p>1 cup of warm water
2 teaspoons of sugar
1 teaspoon of active dry yeast
3 cups of all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon of salt
2 tablespoons of unsalted butter, melted</p><p>Combine the yeast and sugar in a small bowl, then gradually add the warm water, stirring to dissolve. Let the mixture sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and melted butter. Add the yeast mixture and mix until a shaggy dough forms. Knead for 10-15 minutes until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. Form into a ball, place in a greased bowl, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Punch down the dough and shape into a long, thin baguette. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
Seafood Roulade
For a more substantial offering, try making a seafood roulade. This dish is a delightful combination of flavors and textures, with succulent shrimp, delicate scallops, and flaky salmon all wrapped up in a delicate pastry.
To make the filling, you'll need:</p><p>1 pound of large shrimp, peeled and deveined
1 pound of scallops
1/2 pound of salmon fillet, diced
2 tablespoons of unsalted butter, softened
1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard
1 tablespoon of chopped fresh parsley
Salt and pepper to taste</p><p>Begin by cooking the seafood in a separate pan until lightly browned, then set aside. In a separate pan, melt the butter and whisk in the mustard. Add the shrimp and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until pink and slightly curled. Stir in the scallops and cook until they're lightly browned. Stir in the salmon and cook for an additional minute. Set aside and let cool to room temperature. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooled seafood mixture, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix gently until just combined.
For the pastry dough, you'll need:</p><p>2 cups of all-purpose flour
1 cup of cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
1/4 cup of ice-cold water</p><p>Combine the flour and butter in a mixing bowl, using a pastry blender or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the water, stirring with a fork until the dough comes together in a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a large rectangle. Spread the cooled seafood mixture down the center of the dough, leaving a 1-inch border on either side. Fold the edges of the dough over the filling and press gently to seal. Brush with egg wash and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until golden brown.
Ratatouille
No French picnic is complete without a hearty, flavorful ratatouille. This classic Provençal dish is a staple of French cuisine, made with tender vegetables and a rich, herby sauce. To make ratatouille, you'll need:</p><p>2 medium eggplants, sliced into 1/4-inch thick rounds
1 medium zucchini, sliced into 1/4-inch thick rounds
1 medium bell pepper, sliced into 1/4-inch thick rings
1 large onion, sliced into 1/4-inch thick rings
4 cloves of garlic, minced
1 cup of tomato puree
1 cup of chicken broth
2 tablespoons of olive oil
1 tablespoon of chopped fresh thyme
Salt and pepper to taste</p><p>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the eggplant and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until lightly browned. Remove and set aside. Add the zucchini and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until lightly browned. Remove and set aside. Add the bell pepper and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until lightly browned. Remove and set aside. Add the onion and cook for 4-5 minutes, or until lightly caramelized. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the tomato puree and broth, and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and let cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the eggplant, zucchini, and bell pepper back to the skillet and continue to cook for an additional 5 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and thyme.
Tarte Tatin
For dessert, try making a tarte Tatin, a classic French dessert that's sure to impress. This caramelized apple tart is a staple of French patisserie, and with our simplified recipe, you'll be able to create it with ease.
To make the filling, you'll need:</p><p>6-8 medium apples, peeled and sliced
1 cup of granulated sugar
2 tablespoons of unsalted butter
1 teaspoon of cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg</p><p>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the apples and cook for 5-7 minutes, or until they're tender and lightly caramelized. Sprinkle the sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg over the apples and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.
For the pastry dough, you'll need:</p><p>2 cups of all-purpose flour
1 cup of cold unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
1/4 cup of ice-cold water</p><p>Combine the flour and butter in a mixing bowl, using a pastry blender or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse crumbs. Gradually add the water, stirring with a fork until the dough comes together in a ball. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a large circle. Place the cooled apple mixture in the center of the dough and fold the edges of the dough over the filling, pressing gently to seal. Brush with egg wash and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.
