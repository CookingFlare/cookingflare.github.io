Here&rsquo;s how you can make these irresistible cinnamon apple chips right in your kitchen.</p><h2 id=ingredients>Ingredients</h2><h3 id=for-the-apple-chips>For the Apple Chips:</h3><ul><li>4 medium-sized apples (choose a firm variety like Fuji, Gala, or Granny Smith for best results)</li><li>1 tablespoon ground cinnamon</li><li>1–2 teaspoons of sweetener (optional, such as maple syrup, agave, or coconut sugar)</li><li>1 tablespoon lemon juice (to prevent browning)</li><li>A pinch of sea salt (optional, for added flavor)</li></ul><h2 id=equipment-needed>Equipment Needed:</h2><ul><li>Sharp knife or mandoline slicer</li><li>Baking sheet(s)</li><li>Parchment paper or silicone baking mats</li><li>Cooling rack (optional, for extra crispness)</li></ul><h2 id=instructions>Instructions</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-apples>Step 1: Prepare the Apples</h3><p>Start by washing your apples thoroughly to remove any dirt or wax. Once they’re clean, core and slice the apples. You can do this by hand using a sharp knife or, for consistency, use a mandoline slicer to get even thin slices. The key to perfectly crisp apple chips is to slice the apples very thinly, about 1/8 inch thick. This allows the chips to dry out and crisp up evenly in the oven.</p><p>To prevent browning, immediately toss the apple slices in lemon juice. This step will help keep the apples looking fresh while they bake and also add a slight tanginess to the chips.</p><h3 id=step-2-season-the-apple-slices>Step 2: Season the Apple Slices</h3><p>Once the apples are sliced and coated in lemon juice, it&rsquo;s time to season them. In a small bowl, mix together the ground cinnamon and sweetener of your choice. If you prefer a stronger cinnamon flavor, you can increase the amount of cinnamon to your liking. If you like a little sweetness, add in a teaspoon or two of maple syrup, agave, or coconut sugar.</p><p>Sprinkle the cinnamon mixture over the apple slices and toss them gently to ensure that all the pieces are evenly coated. Make sure to coat both sides of the slices with the seasoning for maximum flavor.</p><h3 id=step-3-arrange-the-apple-slices-on-a-baking-sheet>Step 3: Arrange the Apple Slices on a Baking Sheet</h3><p>Line your baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent the apple slices from sticking. Lay the apple slices out in a single layer on the baking sheet. Avoid overlapping the slices, as this will cause them to bake unevenly. If you need to use multiple baking sheets, feel free to divide the apple slices between them.</p><h3 id=step-4-bake-the-apple-chips>Step 4: Bake the Apple Chips</h3><p>Preheat your oven to 200°F (93°C). This low temperature is essential to help dehydrate the apples slowly without burning them.</p><p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the apple slices for 2 to 3 hours. The exact time will depend on the thickness of your slices and your oven’s settings. After the first hour, check the apple chips every 30 minutes to ensure they are drying out evenly. Flip the apple slices halfway through the baking process to help them crisp up on both sides.</p><p>The apple chips are done when they’re golden brown, crispy, and snap easily when you bend them. If they’re still a little soft, give them some extra time in the oven. Just keep an eye on them to avoid over-baking.</p><h3 id=step-5-cool-and-store>Step 5: Cool and Store</h3><p>Once the apple chips are finished baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes. This will help them crisp up even more as they cool. If you have a cooling rack, transfer the chips to the rack for extra air circulation and crispness.</p><p>Once cooled, store the apple chips in an airtight container at room temperature. They should stay fresh for up to a week, although they’re likely to disappear much sooner!</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-vegan-cinnamon-apple-chips>Tips for Perfect Vegan Cinnamon Apple Chips</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Choose the Right Apples</strong>: The type of apple you use will impact the flavor and texture of your apple chips. Firmer varieties like Fuji, Gala, or Granny Smith apples hold up better during the baking process and result in crispier chips. Avoid soft or mealy apples, as they may become mushy while baking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use a Mandoline for Even Slicing</strong>: If you want perfectly uniform apple slices, a mandoline slicer is your best bet. This tool ensures that all the slices are the same thickness, which leads to even baking and consistent crispiness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Experiment with Flavors</strong>: While cinnamon is the classic spice to pair with apples, don&rsquo;t be afraid to get creative. Try adding a pinch of nutmeg, ginger, or cloves for a spiced apple chip variation. You can even drizzle the finished chips with a little maple syrup or sprinkle a bit of sea salt for a sweet-and-salty twist.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bake Low and Slow</strong>: The key to achieving perfectly crispy apple chips is baking them at a low temperature for a long period of time. While it may take a few hours, this slow drying process ensures that the chips get crisp without burning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make a Big Batch</strong>: These apple chips store well, so feel free to make a large batch. They make a great snack for work, school, or a picnic, and they’re a perfect addition to your meal prep routine.</p></li></ol><h2 id=how-to-enjoy-vegan-cinnamon-apple-chips>How to Enjoy Vegan Cinnamon Apple Chips</h2><p>There are so many ways to enjoy your homemade vegan cinnamon apple chips. Here are a few ideas:</p><ul><li><strong>Snack on them</strong>: The most obvious way to enjoy these chips is just as a snack! Grab a handful when you’re feeling hungry for something crispy and sweet.</li><li><strong>Pair with Nut Butter</strong>: For an added protein boost, try dipping your apple chips in almond butter, peanut butter, or any nut butter of your choice. The creamy texture complements the crispy chips perfectly.</li><li><strong>Top your Oatmeal or Yogurt</strong>: Sprinkle some apple chips over your morning oatmeal or non-dairy yogurt for added texture and flavor.</li><li><strong>Serve with Vegan Cheese</strong>: Serve the chips alongside your favorite vegan cheese for a sweet and savory snack combo.</li><li><strong>Pack them for a Road Trip</strong>: These apple chips are a great snack to take on the go.
