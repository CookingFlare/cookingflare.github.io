In this post, we will guide you through the process of making the best sausage gravy from scratch, so you can enjoy a hearty and satisfying breakfast right at home.</p><h2 id=what-is-sausage-gravy>What is Sausage Gravy?</h2><p>Sausage gravy is a Southern staple that&rsquo;s traditionally served over freshly baked biscuits. The gravy is made from ground pork sausage, milk, flour, and seasonings, creating a rich and creamy sauce. The sausage provides a savory, meaty base, while the milk and flour create the creamy texture that makes this dish so comforting. Often, sausage gravy is enjoyed for breakfast, but it can also be served as a savory brunch or dinner dish.</p><p>Though there are variations of this recipe, the basic ingredients remain the same. The beauty of sausage gravy lies in its simplicity. With just a few basic pantry items and a little bit of time, you can create a dish that&rsquo;s guaranteed to please everyone at the table.</p><h2 id=why-this-is-the-best-sausage-gravy-recipe>Why This is the Best Sausage Gravy Recipe</h2><p>When it comes to sausage gravy, everyone has their preferences. Some like it spicy, while others prefer a milder version. Some enjoy a thicker gravy, while others prefer it to be on the thinner side. This recipe strikes the perfect balance between all these factors, ensuring that you&rsquo;ll end up with a creamy, flavorful, and perfectly seasoned gravy every time.</p><p>This recipe is also incredibly versatile. You can adjust the seasoning to your liking, whether you prefer it with a bit more heat from cayenne pepper or a smoother flavor with the addition of herbs like thyme or rosemary. Moreover, the recipe is easy to follow, making it a great choice for both beginner cooks and seasoned pros.</p><h2 id=key-ingredients-for-the-best-sausage-gravy>Key Ingredients for the Best Sausage Gravy</h2><h3 id=1-ground-sausage>1. Ground Sausage</h3><p>The foundation of any great sausage gravy is the sausage itself. You&rsquo;ll want to use high-quality, flavorful sausage. While many people opt for pork sausage, you can also use turkey sausage or chicken sausage for a lighter option. Make sure to use sausage that has a good amount of fat, as this will help create a rich and flavorful base for the gravy.</p><h3 id=2-all-purpose-flour>2. All-Purpose Flour</h3><p>The flour acts as a thickening agent, giving the gravy its creamy consistency. You&rsquo;ll need a bit of flour to cook with the sausage fat to create the roux, which is the base for the gravy.</p><h3 id=3-milk>3. Milk</h3><p>Whole milk is the best option for this recipe as it adds to the richness and creaminess of the gravy. If you want a lighter version, you can substitute with a lower-fat milk, but the gravy may not be as thick or creamy. For an extra indulgent version, you can also use half-and-half or heavy cream.</p><h3 id=4-butter>4. Butter</h3><p>A little bit of butter enhances the flavor and richness of the gravy. Youâ€™ll cook the sausage in the butter, which adds another layer of flavor to the dish.</p><h3 id=5-seasonings>5. Seasonings</h3><p>Sausage gravy is all about the seasoning. Salt and pepper are a must, but other spices can help elevate the flavor. Common additions include crushed red pepper flakes for a little heat, garlic powder for depth, and a pinch of thyme or sage for a savory twist. If you like it spicy, add a dash of cayenne pepper to taste.</p><h3 id=6-biscuits>6. Biscuits</h3><p>No sausage gravy recipe would be complete without biscuits to serve it on! You can make homemade biscuits from scratch or use store-bought biscuits for convenience. The flaky, buttery texture of a biscuit is the perfect vehicle for soaking up all that creamy sausage gravy.</p><h2 id=how-to-make-the-best-sausage-gravy>How to Make the Best Sausage Gravy</h2><p>Now that we have all the ingredients ready, let&rsquo;s dive into the steps to make the best sausage gravy for breakfast.</p><h3 id=step-1-cook-the-sausage>Step 1: Cook the Sausage</h3><p>Start by heating a large skillet over medium heat. Add your ground sausage to the skillet and break it apart with a spoon or spatula. Cook the sausage until it&rsquo;s fully browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. The sausage should release some fat as it cooks, which is essential for making the gravy.</p><p>As the sausage cooks, be sure to stir it occasionally, ensuring that it browns evenly. If you&rsquo;re using lean sausage, you might need to add a little bit of butter or oil to the pan to prevent it from sticking.</p><h3 id=step-2-make-the-roux>Step 2: Make the Roux</h3><p>Once the sausage is browned and crumbled, sprinkle the flour over the sausage. Stir well to coat the sausage evenly with the flour. Cook this mixture for about 2 minutes to allow the flour to absorb the fat and form a roux. This step is crucial as it helps thicken the gravy.</p><p>You want to cook the flour long enough to remove any raw flour taste but not so long that it darkens. The goal is to keep the gravy light and creamy, not heavy or too thick.</p><h3 id=step-3-add-the-milk>Step 3: Add the Milk</h3><p>Slowly pour in the milk while continuously stirring the sausage and flour mixture. The milk will start to thicken as it combines with the roux, creating a creamy consistency. Keep stirring until the mixture reaches your desired thickness.</p><p>If the gravy is too thick for your liking, you can add a bit more milk, a tablespoon at a time, until you reach the perfect consistency. On the other hand, if the gravy is too thin, let it cook a little longer, and it will naturally thicken up.</p><h3 id=step-4-season-the-gravy>Step 4: Season the Gravy</h3><p>Once the gravy has thickened to your liking, itâ€™s time to season it. Start by adding salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. If you prefer a bit of heat, you can add red pepper flakes or cayenne pepper at this stage. For an extra savory touch, a pinch of thyme or sage works wonders.</p><p>Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning as needed. You may want to add a little more salt, pepper, or spice depending on your preference.</p><h3 id=step-5-serve-the-gravy>Step 5: Serve the Gravy</h3><p>Now that your sausage gravy is ready, itâ€™s time to serve it! Ladle the creamy, savory gravy over a warm biscuit and enjoy. The rich, meaty gravy pairs perfectly with the soft, flaky biscuit, creating a comforting and satisfying breakfast.</p><h3 id=step-6-optional-garnishes>Step 6: Optional Garnishes</h3><p>If you want to elevate your sausage gravy even more, consider adding a few garnishes. Chopped fresh parsley or chives can add a pop of color and freshness to the dish. For a bit of extra indulgence, you could even sprinkle some shredded cheddar cheese on top of the gravy before serving.</p><h2 id=tips-for-making-the-perfect-sausage-gravy>Tips for Making the Perfect Sausage Gravy</h2><ol><li><strong>Use Quality Sausage</strong>: The better the sausage, the better your gravy will taste. Look for sausage with a good amount of flavor and fat for the best results.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t Rush the Roux</strong>: Cooking the flour for a couple of minutes before adding the milk helps to create a smooth and creamy gravy. Donâ€™t rush this step!</li><li><strong>Adjust the Consistency</strong>: If you prefer thicker gravy, cook it a little longer. If it&rsquo;s too thick, add more milk. It&rsquo;s all about finding the right balance for your taste.</li><li><strong>Serve Immediately</strong>: Sausage gravy is best served fresh, while it&rsquo;s still hot and creamy. The gravy can thicken as it cools, so if you&rsquo;re making it in advance, you may need to add more milk when reheating it.</li></ol><h2 id=how-to-make-this-recipe-ahead-of-time>How to Make This Recipe Ahead of Time</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re hosting a brunch or want to make your breakfast easier, you can prepare the sausage gravy ahead of time. Simply follow the recipe as directed and allow the gravy to cool completely before storing it in an airtight container in the refrigerator. When you&rsquo;re ready to serve, simply reheat the gravy on the stovetop over low heat, adding a bit of milk to bring it back to its creamy consistency.</p><h2 id=variations-on-sausage-gravy>Variations on Sausage Gravy</h2><p>While this recipe is already delicious on its own, there are plenty of ways to customize your sausage gravy:</p><ul><li><strong>Spicy Sausage Gravy</strong>: Use spicy sausage or add more cayenne pepper for an extra kick.</li><li><strong>Vegetarian Sausage Gravy</strong>: For a vegetarian version, substitute the ground sausage with plant-based sausage or use sautÃ©ed mushrooms for a meaty texture.</li><li><strong>Cheesy Sausage Gravy</strong>: Add a handful of shredded cheddar cheese to the gravy for a cheesy twist.</li><li><strong>Herbed Sausage Gravy</strong>: Incorporate fresh herbs like rosemary, thyme, or sage for a fragrant and savory flavor.</li></ul><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>The best sausage gravy recipe is all about balanceâ€”rich, creamy, savory, and full of flavor.
