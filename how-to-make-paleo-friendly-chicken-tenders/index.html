This recipe for paleo-friendly chicken tenders is the perfect solution for satisfying your cravings without compromising your health goals. Using wholesome, nutrient-dense ingredients, this dish delivers a crispy, golden-brown crust on the outside while keeping the chicken tender and juicy on the inside. Plus, it’s simple to make, requires minimal ingredients, and is a crowd-pleaser for both adults and kids alike.</p><h2 id=what-is-the-paleo-diet>What is the Paleo Diet?</h2><p>Before diving into the recipe, let&rsquo;s take a moment to understand the paleo diet and what it entails. The paleo diet is based on eating whole, unprocessed foods similar to those consumed by our pre-agricultural ancestors. It focuses on meats, seafood, vegetables, fruits, nuts, and seeds, while eliminating grains, legumes, dairy, processed foods, and refined sugars. By focusing on nutrient-rich, naturally occurring foods, the paleo diet promotes better overall health and well-being.</p><p>When making paleo-friendly recipes, the key is to avoid common ingredients that don&rsquo;t fit within the paleo guidelines. For chicken tenders, this means finding alternatives to traditional breadcrumbs and flour that are both healthy and delicious.</p><h2 id=ingredients-for-paleo-chicken-tenders>Ingredients for Paleo Chicken Tenders</h2><p>To create these crispy chicken tenders, you’ll need a few simple ingredients that are paleo-approved. These include:</p><h3 id=for-the-chicken>For the Chicken:</h3><ul><li><strong>Chicken tenders</strong> – You can use whole chicken breasts and cut them into strips, but pre-cut chicken tenders are often more convenient.</li><li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong> – Season the chicken to taste.</li><li><strong>Garlic powder</strong> – Adds a savory depth of flavor to the tenders.</li><li><strong>Onion powder</strong> – Brings a bit of sweetness and flavor balance.</li><li><strong>Cayenne pepper (optional)</strong> – If you like a bit of heat, cayenne pepper is a great addition.</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-paleo-breading>For the Paleo &ldquo;Breading&rdquo;:</h3><ul><li><strong>Almond flour</strong> – A popular gluten-free and paleo-friendly flour alternative, almond flour provides the perfect base for a crispy coating.</li><li><strong>Coconut flour</strong> – Coconut flour helps to give the tenders a slightly denser texture and adds a subtle coconut flavor that pairs well with the chicken.</li><li><strong>Ground flaxseeds</strong> – Ground flaxseeds help to add a bit of crunch and nutrition to the breading while keeping everything in line with paleo principles.</li><li><strong>Paleo-friendly breadcrumbs (optional)</strong> – If you&rsquo;re looking for an extra crunch, you can use homemade paleo breadcrumbs, often made from coconut or almond flour. This is optional, but it can really elevate the texture.</li></ul><h3 id=for-dipping>For Dipping:</h3><ul><li><strong>Eggs</strong> – Eggs help bind the breading to the chicken and create that golden, crispy crust.</li><li><strong>Mustard or avocado oil</strong> – A good oil for pan-frying the tenders. Avocado oil is a great option as it&rsquo;s high in healthy fats and can withstand high cooking temperatures.</li></ul><h3 id=for-serving>For Serving:</h3><ul><li><strong>Lemon wedges</strong> – A squeeze of fresh lemon juice enhances the flavor of the chicken tenders and adds a refreshing contrast to the rich, crispy breading.</li><li><strong>Your favorite paleo dipping sauce</strong> – This can be anything from a tangy mustard sauce to a creamy avocado dip or homemade paleo ranch dressing.</li></ul><h2 id=step-by-step-guide-to-making-paleo-chicken-tenders>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Paleo Chicken Tenders</h2><p>Making paleo chicken tenders is straightforward, and the results are incredibly rewarding. Here&rsquo;s how you can do it:</p><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-chicken>Step 1: Prepare the Chicken</h3><p>Start by preparing the chicken tenders. If you&rsquo;re using whole chicken breasts, slice them into strips, aiming for tender-sized pieces that will cook evenly. Season the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper (if using). Toss the chicken in the seasoning until each piece is well-coated. Set the chicken aside and move on to preparing the breading.</p><h3 id=step-2-make-the-paleo-breading>Step 2: Make the Paleo Breading</h3><p>In a shallow bowl, combine the almond flour, coconut flour, ground flaxseeds, and any optional paleo breadcrumbs. This mixture will form the &ldquo;breading&rdquo; for your tenders. Stir the dry ingredients together until they are evenly mixed.</p><p>In a separate bowl, crack two eggs and whisk them together until smooth. The eggs will help the breading adhere to the chicken tenders.</p><h3 id=step-3-coat-the-chicken-tenders>Step 3: Coat the Chicken Tenders</h3><p>Now, it&rsquo;s time to coat the chicken. Take each seasoned chicken strip and dip it into the egg wash, ensuring it’s fully covered. Next, roll the chicken in the dry breading mixture, pressing gently to ensure the breading sticks. Repeat this process for each piece of chicken, making sure each tender is evenly coated.</p><h3 id=step-4-fry-the-chicken-tenders>Step 4: Fry the Chicken Tenders</h3><p>Heat a couple of tablespoons of avocado oil or your preferred paleo-friendly cooking oil in a large skillet over medium heat. You want the oil to be hot but not smoking, as this will help achieve that crispy, golden texture.</p><p>Once the oil is heated, add the coated chicken tenders to the skillet, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side, or until the chicken is golden brown and cooked through. If needed, work in batches to avoid overcrowding.</p><h3 id=step-5-drain-and-serve>Step 5: Drain and Serve</h3><p>Once the tenders are cooked to perfection, remove them from the skillet and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. This will help keep the tenders crispy and prevent them from becoming greasy.</p><p>Serve your paleo chicken tenders hot, with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice on top. You can also offer your favorite dipping sauce on the side to enhance the flavor.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-paleo-chicken-tenders>Tips for Perfect Paleo Chicken Tenders</h2><p>While the recipe is straightforward, there are a few tips and tricks that will help ensure your chicken tenders turn out perfectly every time:</p><h3 id=1-dont-overcrowd-the-pan>1. <strong>Don’t Overcrowd the Pan</strong></h3><p>Overcrowding the pan while frying can cause the chicken tenders to steam instead of crisping up. This can lead to soggy tenders. Always fry in batches if necessary to give the tenders enough space to cook evenly.</p><h3 id=2-use-the-right-oil>2. <strong>Use the Right Oil</strong></h3><p>When it comes to frying, it&rsquo;s important to use an oil that can withstand high heat. Avocado oil is an excellent choice because of its high smoke point and health benefits. If you don’t have avocado oil, other oils like coconut oil or ghee are also great options for frying.</p><h3 id=3-double-the-breading-for-extra-crunch>3. <strong>Double the Breading for Extra Crunch</strong></h3><p>If you want a thicker, crunchier coating, feel free to dip the chicken tenders in the egg wash and breading mixture twice. This double-dipping process will create an extra layer of crispy goodness.</p><h3 id=4-add-herbs-and-spices-for-extra-flavor>4. <strong>Add Herbs and Spices for Extra Flavor</strong></h3><p>Don’t be afraid to experiment with different herbs and spices. Consider adding dried herbs like thyme, oregano, or parsley to the breading mixture for an extra layer of flavor. You can also try seasoning the tenders with paprika or smoked paprika for a deeper, smoky flavor.</p><h3 id=5-baking-option>5. <strong>Baking Option</strong></h3><p>If you prefer to bake your chicken tenders instead of frying them, that’s an option too! Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Place the breaded chicken tenders on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown and crispy. Baking is a healthier alternative if you&rsquo;re looking to reduce the amount of oil used in the recipe.</p><h2 id=why-choose-paleo-friendly-chicken-tenders>Why Choose Paleo-Friendly Chicken Tenders?</h2><p>Making paleo-friendly chicken tenders instead of regular ones brings a number of benefits. Here are a few reasons why you should consider this healthier alternative:</p><h3 id=1-no-gluten-or-grains>1. <strong>No Gluten or Grains</strong></h3><p>Traditional chicken tenders often use breadcrumbs made from wheat, which contain gluten and grains. Since the paleo diet eliminates grains, using almond and coconut flour for the breading keeps these tenders gluten-free while still providing a satisfying crunch.</p><h3 id=2-nutrient-dense-ingredients>2. <strong>Nutrient-Dense Ingredients</strong></h3><p>Almond flour and coconut flour provide a great source of healthy fats and fiber, which contribute to the nutritional value of the meal. The addition of flaxseeds boosts the omega-3 content, which is great for heart health.</p><h3 id=3-lower-in-carbohydrates>3. <strong>Lower in Carbohydrates</strong></h3><p>Unlike traditional chicken tenders that use breadcrumbs or flour, this paleo version is lower in carbohydrates. If you&rsquo;re following a low-carb or ketogenic diet, these tenders fit perfectly into your meal plan.</p><h3 id=4-satisfying-and-delicious>4. <strong>Satisfying and Delicious</strong></h3><p>Despite being a healthier alternative, these chicken tenders are still just as satisfying and delicious as their traditional counterparts. The crispy, golden exterior and juicy interior make for a perfect comfort food option that doesn’t sacrifice flavor.</p><h2 id=how-to-serve-paleo-chicken-tenders>How to Serve Paleo Chicken Tenders</h2><p>Paleo chicken tenders are versatile and can be served in a variety of ways. Here are a few ideas to make your meal even more satisfying:</p><h3 id=1-with-a-side-salad>1. <strong>With a Side Salad</strong></h3><p>Pair your chicken tenders with a fresh, colorful salad made from mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, and a light olive oil vinaigrette. This creates a well-rounded meal with plenty of healthy fats and vegetables.</p><h3 id=2-alongside-roasted-vegetables>2. <strong>Alongside Roasted Vegetables</strong></h3><p>For a hearty meal, serve your tenders with roasted veggies like sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, or cauliflower. These nutritious sides complement the crispy tenders and round out the dish.</p><h3 id=3-in-a-wrap-or-lettuce-cup>3. <strong>In a Wrap or Lettuce Cup</strong></h3><p>For a fun twist, place the chicken tenders in a lettuce wrap or a paleo-friendly tortilla. Add some fresh veggies, avocado, and your favorite sauce for a delicious and portable meal.</p><h3 id=4-with-a-delicious-dipping-sauce>4. <strong>With a Delicious Dipping Sauce</strong></h3><p>No chicken tender meal is complete without a dipping sauce! Make sure to serve your tenders with a tasty paleo-friendly dip, such as a tangy mustard sauce, creamy avocado dip, or homemade paleo ranch dressing.</p><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Making paleo-friendly chicken tenders is a fantastic way to enjoy a delicious, crispy treat without compromising your dietary preferences.
