It&rsquo;s not only packed with flavor but also healthy, thanks to the abundance of seafood and olive oil, both staples of the Mediterranean diet. Let’s dive into the recipe and discover how to make this irresistible dish.</p><h2 id=ingredients>Ingredients</h2><p>To make this Mediterranean seafood spaghetti, you&rsquo;ll need the following ingredients. The seafood selection in this recipe is versatile, so feel free to customize it based on your preferences or availability. Fresh seafood is always the best option, but if fresh seafood isn&rsquo;t available, frozen varieties can work just as well.</p><ul><li><strong>200g spaghetti</strong> – Choose high-quality pasta for the best texture and flavor. Spaghetti is the traditional pasta choice, but linguine or fettuccine also work well.</li><li><strong>400g mixed seafood</strong> – A combination of shrimp, squid, mussels, and clams makes for a delightful mix, but feel free to include other seafood like scallops or octopus.</li><li><strong>4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</strong> – Olive oil is a cornerstone of Greek cuisine, lending a rich, fruity flavor to the dish.</li><li><strong>5 cloves garlic</strong> – Thinly sliced, garlic adds a lovely aroma and depth of flavor to the dish.</li><li><strong>1 teaspoon dried oregano</strong> – This herb is a classic flavor profile in Greek cuisine and pairs beautifully with seafood.</li><li><strong>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</strong> – For a slight kick of heat, adjust according to your preference.</li><li><strong>1/2 cup white wine</strong> – A dry white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio adds acidity and depth to the sauce.</li><li><strong>1/2 lemon</strong> – Fresh lemon juice will brighten up the dish and complement the seafood.</li><li><strong>Fresh parsley</strong> – Chopped parsley for garnish, adding a touch of color and freshness to the finished dish.</li><li><strong>Salt and black pepper</strong> – To season the dish to taste.</li></ul><h2 id=preparing-the-seafood>Preparing the Seafood</h2><p>The first step in making this Greek-style seafood spaghetti is to prepare the seafood. If you&rsquo;re using frozen seafood, make sure it’s properly thawed and patted dry to remove excess moisture. Fresh seafood, on the other hand, should be rinsed under cold water to remove any sand or debris.</p><p>For this recipe, the seafood will be lightly sautéed in olive oil to preserve its delicate flavors. It&rsquo;s essential not to overcrowd the pan so the seafood can cook evenly. Sautéing the seafood separately before combining it with the pasta ensures it stays tender and doesn’t become overcooked.</p><h3 id=sautéing-the-seafood>Sautéing the Seafood</h3><ol><li><p>Heat <strong>2 tablespoons of olive oil</strong> in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the seafood. Begin by cooking the <strong>shrimp</strong> and <strong>squid</strong>, as they will take a little longer than mussels and clams. Cook the shrimp for about 2-3 minutes, or until they turn pink and opaque. The squid should take 2 minutes to cook through, just until it becomes tender and opaque.</p></li><li><p>Add the <strong>mussels</strong> and <strong>clams</strong> to the pan. Cover the skillet with a lid and cook for about 3-4 minutes, or until the shells have opened up. Discard any mussels or clams that remain closed.</p></li><li><p>Once all the seafood is cooked, remove it from the skillet and set it aside. You can cover it loosely with foil to keep it warm while you prepare the pasta and sauce.</p></li></ol><h2 id=cooking-the-spaghetti>Cooking the Spaghetti</h2><p>While the seafood is resting, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the <strong>spaghetti</strong> and cook according to the package instructions, usually around 8-10 minutes, until the pasta is al dente. It’s important not to overcook the pasta, as it will continue to cook in the sauce later on.</p><p>Once the pasta is ready, drain it, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta cooking water. This starchy water will help thicken the sauce and help it adhere to the noodles. Set the drained spaghetti aside and proceed with the next steps.</p><h2 id=making-the-garlic-and-olive-oil-sauce>Making the Garlic and Olive Oil Sauce</h2><p>Now comes the heart of this dish – the garlic and olive oil sauce. The key to Greek-style pasta lies in the simplicity and richness of the olive oil-based sauce, which allows the natural flavors of the seafood to shine through.</p><ol><li><p>In the same skillet used to sauté the seafood, add the remaining <strong>2 tablespoons of olive oil</strong> over medium heat. Allow the oil to heat up before adding the <strong>garlic</strong>. Sauté the garlic for 1-2 minutes, or until fragrant. Be careful not to let it brown, as burnt garlic can become bitter.</p></li><li><p>Add the <strong>dried oregano</strong> and <strong>red pepper flakes</strong> to the pan. Stir for about 30 seconds to toast the herbs and spices, releasing their essential oils.</p></li><li><p>Pour in the <strong>white wine</strong>, allowing it to simmer for about 2 minutes, letting the alcohol evaporate and the wine reduce slightly. This step adds a subtle acidity and richness to the sauce, complementing the sweetness of the seafood.</p></li><li><p>Squeeze in the <strong>lemon juice</strong> and stir to combine. The lemon adds a refreshing citrusy note that balances the richness of the olive oil and the sweetness of the seafood.</p></li></ol><h2 id=bringing-it-all-together>Bringing It All Together</h2><p>Now that the sauce is ready, it’s time to combine everything.</p><ol><li><p>Add the cooked <strong>spaghetti</strong> to the skillet with the garlic and olive oil sauce. Toss the pasta in the sauce, ensuring it’s well coated. If the pasta looks dry, add a little bit of the reserved pasta cooking water to help loosen the sauce and allow it to cling to the noodles.</p></li><li><p>Gently add the cooked <strong>seafood</strong> back into the pan. Toss everything together carefully, ensuring the seafood is evenly distributed throughout the pasta. Let it cook for another 1-2 minutes to ensure everything is heated through and well combined.</p></li></ol><h2 id=serving-the-seafood-spaghetti-greek-style>Serving the Seafood Spaghetti Greek Style</h2><p>Once everything is well mixed, it’s time to plate your seafood spaghetti Greek style. Serve it immediately, garnished with a generous sprinkle of freshly chopped <strong>parsley</strong>. The parsley will add a burst of color and freshness to the dish, making it even more appealing.</p><p>For extra flavor, you can drizzle a bit more <strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong> over the top before serving, along with a wedge of lemon for those who enjoy a tangy kick.</p><p>This dish pairs wonderfully with a crisp, refreshing white wine like a Sauvignon Blanc or a Greek Assyrtiko. You can also serve it with a simple green salad and some crusty bread to soak up the delicious sauce.</p><h2 id=why-youll-love-this-recipe>Why You’ll Love This Recipe</h2><p>Seafood Spaghetti Greek Style with Garlic and Olive Oil is a dish that beautifully balances simplicity and sophistication. The garlic and olive oil sauce is rich and flavorful without being overwhelming, and the seafood is perfectly cooked, adding both texture and a briny sweetness to each bite. The use of fresh ingredients ensures that every component of this dish shines, making it a true Mediterranean masterpiece.</p><p>This recipe is also highly customizable, so feel free to experiment with different types of seafood based on what&rsquo;s available or what you prefer. If you&rsquo;re a fan of spicy food, you can add more red pepper flakes or even a dash of hot sauce. The key is to keep the ingredients fresh and the preparation simple to let the flavors of the sea come through.</p><p>Additionally, this dish is packed with nutrients, especially omega-3 fatty acids from the seafood and antioxidants from the olive oil and garlic. It’s a healthy yet indulgent meal that can be enjoyed on any occasion, from a weeknight dinner to a special celebration.</p><h2 id=tips-for-success>Tips for Success</h2><ul><li><strong>Don’t overcook the seafood</strong>: Seafood cooks quickly, and overcooking it can result in a rubbery, tough texture. Remove it from the heat as soon as it’s cooked through to ensure the best texture.</li><li><strong>Use high-quality olive oil</strong>: Olive oil is the base of the sauce, so using a good-quality extra virgin olive oil will make a noticeable difference in the flavor of the dish.</li><li><strong>Add pasta cooking water</strong>: The starchy pasta water helps to create a silky sauce that clings to the spaghetti. Make sure to reserve some before draining the pasta.</li><li><strong>Customize the seafood</strong>: Feel free to mix and match seafood based on what’s available. Scallops, crab, and even lobster can be delicious additions.</li></ul><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Seafood Spaghetti Greek Style with Garlic and Olive Oil is a timeless Mediterranean dish that captures the essence of Greek cuisine. With its perfect balance of fresh seafood, garlic, olive oil, and aromatic herbs, it’s a dish that’s simple yet full of flavor. Whether you’re an experienced home cook or just starting out, this recipe is easy to follow and will impress your family and friends.
