It’s an excellent alternative to the more commonly used chicken or ham, making it a great option for those who want to try something different or use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Turkey is also a healthier option, as it&rsquo;s low in fat and rich in nutrients like B vitamins, selenium, and zinc, which are beneficial for your immune system and overall health.</p><p>This turkey chowder with sweet corn recipe offers a great way to incorporate turkey into your meals while enjoying the added richness and sweetness of fresh corn. Whether you choose to use fresh or frozen corn, it adds a beautiful natural sweetness that balances the savory flavors in the soup.</p><h2 id=ingredients-youll-need>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2><h3 id=for-the-chowder-base>For the Chowder Base:</h3><ul><li>1 lb. turkey breast or thighs, cooked and shredded (you can also use leftover turkey from a previous meal)</li><li>1 tablespoon olive oil or butter</li><li>1 medium onion, diced</li><li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>2 medium carrots, peeled and diced</li><li>2 medium potatoes, peeled and diced</li><li>2 cups sweet corn kernels (fresh or frozen)</li><li>1 ½ cups chicken or vegetable broth</li><li>2 cups whole milk or heavy cream (for a richer chowder)</li><li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li><li>1 teaspoon dried thyme (or 2 teaspoons fresh thyme, finely chopped)</li><li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary (or 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped)</li><li>1 bay leaf</li></ul><h3 id=for-garnishing>For Garnishing:</h3><ul><li>Fresh parsley or thyme sprigs</li><li>Crusty bread or crackers (optional)</li></ul><h2 id=step-by-step-guide-to-making-turkey-chowder-with-sweet-corn>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Turkey Chowder with Sweet Corn</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-your-turkey>Step 1: Prepare Your Turkey</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re using leftover turkey, make sure it’s shredded or cut into bite-sized pieces. You can also use turkey breast or thighs, which will need to be cooked before shredding. To cook the turkey, simply season it with salt and pepper, and roast it in the oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 25-30 minutes, or until the meat reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Let the turkey cool slightly before shredding it using a fork or your hands. This shredded turkey will provide the perfect texture and flavor for your chowder.</p><h3 id=step-2-sauté-the-vegetables>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3><p>Heat a tablespoon of olive oil or butter in a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add the diced onion and sauté until it becomes translucent and soft, about 3-4 minutes. Next, add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds, making sure the garlic doesn’t burn.</p><p>Add the diced carrots and potatoes to the pot, stirring to coat them with the onions and garlic. Let them cook for about 5 minutes, allowing the vegetables to soften slightly and absorb the flavors.</p><h3 id=step-3-add-the-broth-and-seasonings>Step 3: Add the Broth and Seasonings</h3><p>Once the vegetables are softened, pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and add the bay leaf, thyme, and rosemary. Stir everything together, making sure the seasonings are evenly distributed. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are tender.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-the-sweet-corn-and-turkey>Step 4: Add the Sweet Corn and Turkey</h3><p>Once the vegetables are tender, it’s time to add the sweet corn kernels. If you&rsquo;re using fresh corn, simply slice the kernels off the cob, or if you’re using frozen corn, just toss it straight into the pot. Stir to combine the corn with the vegetables and broth.</p><p>Next, add the shredded turkey into the pot and stir well. The turkey will heat through and take on the flavors of the broth. Allow the mixture to simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes, ensuring everything is heated thoroughly.</p><h3 id=step-5-stir-in-the-milk-or-cream>Step 5: Stir in the Milk or Cream</h3><p>Now, it’s time to add the creaminess that will give this chowder its luxurious texture. Pour in the whole milk or heavy cream, depending on your preference for richness. Stir the mixture gently, and let the chowder simmer for another 5 minutes. This will allow the flavors to meld together while thickening the chowder to your desired consistency.</p><h3 id=step-6-taste-and-adjust-seasonings>Step 6: Taste and Adjust Seasonings</h3><p>Before serving, give the chowder a taste and adjust the seasonings as needed. Add more salt, pepper, or herbs if necessary. If you prefer a thicker chowder, let it simmer a bit longer until it reaches your preferred consistency. If it’s too thick, feel free to add a little more milk or broth to thin it out.</p><h3 id=step-7-serve-and-garnish>Step 7: Serve and Garnish</h3><p>Once your turkey chowder with sweet corn is ready, ladle it into bowls and garnish with fresh parsley or thyme sprigs for a burst of color and freshness. Serve the chowder with crusty bread or crackers on the side to complete the meal.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfecting-your-turkey-chowder-with-sweet-corn>Tips for Perfecting Your Turkey Chowder with Sweet Corn</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Use Fresh or Frozen Corn:</strong> Whether you opt for fresh or frozen sweet corn, both will work beautifully in this chowder. Fresh corn adds a natural, slightly crunchy texture, while frozen corn is just as sweet and convenient. If you can get fresh corn during summer, try using it for the best flavor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it Richer with Heavy Cream:</strong> If you want an ultra-creamy chowder, use heavy cream instead of milk. The cream will make the soup velvety smooth and rich, perfect for a luxurious dining experience.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customize Your Vegetables:</strong> Feel free to mix up the vegetables based on what you have on hand. Leeks, celery, or parsnips could be great additions. You can also add green beans or peas for extra color and nutrition.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add Spice for a Kick:</strong> If you enjoy a little heat, consider adding a pinch of cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes to the chowder.

You can also make it ahead of time, as it reheats well and the flavors only get better the next day.</p></li><li><p><strong>Leftover Turkey:</strong> This chowder is an ideal way to use up leftover turkey from holidays like Thanksgiving or Christmas.
