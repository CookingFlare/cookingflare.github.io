The creamy, hearty soup filled with tender chicken and soft, fluffy dumplings is the epitome of cozy. While traditional recipes can take a while to prepare, using an Instant Pot can simplify the process and get dinner on the table faster without compromising flavor. In this post, we&rsquo;ll guide you through making delicious Instant Pot chicken and dumplings, a recipe that will become your go-to for busy weeknights and family gatherings.</p><h2 id=why-use-an-instant-pot-for-chicken-and-dumplings>Why Use an Instant Pot for Chicken and Dumplings?</h2><p>Instant Pots have become a kitchen staple for many home cooks. These versatile pressure cookers can cut down cooking times while still delivering rich, flavorful dishes. When it comes to chicken and dumplings, the Instant Pot is particularly useful because it allows you to cook the chicken quickly, create a flavorful broth, and prepare the dumplings all in one pot.</p><p>The beauty of using an Instant Pot is that you can have a hearty, comforting meal in about 45 minutes. No need to spend hours simmering a broth or baking dumplings separately. The Instant Pot does it all, and the result is a creamy, mouthwatering dish that the whole family will love.</p><h2 id=ingredients-for-instant-pot-chicken-and-dumplings>Ingredients for Instant Pot Chicken and Dumplings</h2><p>To make Instant Pot chicken and dumplings, you&rsquo;ll need the following ingredients:</p><h3 id=for-the-chicken-and-broth>For the Chicken and Broth:</h3><ul><li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs (both work well)</li><li>1 tablespoon olive oil or butter</li><li>1 small onion, diced</li><li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li><li>3 medium carrots, peeled and sliced</li><li>3 celery stalks, sliced</li><li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li><li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li><li>1 bay leaf</li><li>4 cups chicken broth (low-sodium is best)</li><li>1 cup heavy cream</li><li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li><li>1 tablespoon cornstarch (optional, for thickening)</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-dumplings>For the Dumplings:</h3><ul><li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li><li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li><li>½ teaspoon salt</li><li>½ teaspoon garlic powder (optional)</li><li>½ teaspoon dried thyme (optional)</li><li>¾ cup milk</li><li>1 large egg</li><li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li></ul><p>These ingredients will make a hearty and filling meal that serves about four people, though you can easily adjust the recipe for more servings.</p><h2 id=step-by-step-instructions-for-instant-pot-chicken-and-dumplings>Step-by-Step Instructions for Instant Pot Chicken and Dumplings</h2><h3 id=step-1-sauté-the-vegetables-and-chicken>Step 1: Sauté the Vegetables and Chicken</h3><p>Start by setting your Instant Pot to the <strong>Sauté</strong> function and heating the olive oil or butter. Add the diced onion, carrots, and celery to the pot and sauté them for about 4-5 minutes, or until they begin to soften. Add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute, allowing the garlic to become fragrant.</p><p>Next, season the chicken breasts or thighs with salt, pepper, dried thyme, and dried rosemary. Add the chicken to the pot and sear both sides for 2-3 minutes. This step helps to lock in flavor, and it also adds a bit of color to the chicken.</p><h3 id=step-2-add-the-broth-and-pressure-cook>Step 2: Add the Broth and Pressure Cook</h3><p>Once the chicken is browned, pour in the chicken broth and add the bay leaf. Stir to combine all the ingredients, making sure that the chicken is fully submerged in the broth. If you&rsquo;re using cornstarch for thickening, you can add it now, or you can wait until after pressure cooking.</p><p>Seal the Instant Pot lid and set the vent to <strong>Sealing</strong>. Select the <strong>Pressure Cook</strong> or <strong>Manual</strong> setting and adjust the time to <strong>10 minutes</strong> at high pressure. This is enough time for the chicken to cook through and become tender, allowing it to shred easily later.</p><h3 id=step-3-prepare-the-dumplings>Step 3: Prepare the Dumplings</h3><p>While the chicken is cooking, prepare the dumplings. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and any optional seasonings like garlic powder or thyme. In a separate bowl, whisk the milk, egg, and melted butter together until well combined.</p><p>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. The dough will be thick, but that’s okay—it’s meant to be a bit sticky.</p><h3 id=step-4-shred-the-chicken-and-add-the-dumplings>Step 4: Shred the Chicken and Add the Dumplings</h3><p>When the Instant Pot timer goes off, perform a quick release by turning the venting knob to <strong>Venting</strong>. Carefully remove the lid and use tongs to remove the chicken from the pot. Set the chicken aside to cool for a few minutes before shredding it using two forks.</p><p>Return the shredded chicken to the Instant Pot, and stir the soup to combine all the ingredients. At this point, you can taste the broth and adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.</p><p>Next, drop spoonfuls of the dumpling dough into the broth. These dumplings will puff up as they cook, so don&rsquo;t worry if they seem small at first. You should aim for about 8-10 spoonfuls of dough, but this will vary depending on the size of your spoon.</p><h3 id=step-5-cook-the-dumplings>Step 5: Cook the Dumplings</h3><p>Close the Instant Pot lid again, set the vent to <strong>Sealing</strong>, and cook the dumplings using the <strong>Pressure Cook</strong> function for <strong>5 minutes</strong> at high pressure. This short cooking time ensures the dumplings cook through while remaining tender and fluffy.</p><p>When the timer goes off, perform a quick release by turning the vent to <strong>Venting</strong>. Be cautious of the steam when releasing the pressure.</p><h3 id=step-6-finish-and-serve>Step 6: Finish and Serve</h3><p>Once the pressure has been released, open the lid and check the dumplings. They should be light and fluffy, floating on top of the broth. Give everything a gentle stir to incorporate the chicken and dumplings with the broth. If you&rsquo;d like the soup to be thicker, you can stir in a bit more cornstarch or let it simmer on the sauté function for a few minutes.</p><p>Serve the Instant Pot chicken and dumplings hot, garnished with fresh parsley or thyme if desired. Pair it with a simple side salad or some crusty bread for a complete meal.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-chicken-and-dumplings>Tips for Perfect Chicken and Dumplings</h2><p>While the recipe is straightforward, there are a few tips to keep in mind to make sure your chicken and dumplings turn out perfectly every time:</p><h3 id=1-chicken-selection>1. <strong>Chicken Selection</strong></h3><p>Both chicken breasts and thighs work well in this recipe. Chicken thighs are more flavorful and stay juicy during cooking, while chicken breasts are leaner and cook up tender. Choose based on your preference!</p><h3 id=2-dumpling-consistency>2. <strong>Dumpling Consistency</strong></h3><p>The dumpling dough should be thick but not dry. If it’s too dry, add a bit more milk to loosen it up. On the other hand, if it’s too runny, add a little extra flour to help it hold together.</p><h3 id=3-adjust-the-seasonings>3. <strong>Adjust the Seasonings</strong></h3><p>Feel free to customize the seasonings to your taste. Some people like to add a pinch of cayenne pepper or paprika for a bit of heat. You can also use fresh herbs instead of dried for more vibrant flavor.</p><h3 id=4-making-it-ahead>4. <strong>Making It Ahead</strong></h3><p>If you want to make this recipe ahead of time, prepare the chicken and broth in the Instant Pot as directed, but don&rsquo;t add the dumplings until you&rsquo;re ready to serve. Store the soup and dumplings separately, and cook the dumplings fresh when you&rsquo;re ready to eat.</p><h3 id=5-vegetable-variations>5. <strong>Vegetable Variations</strong></h3><p>If you’d like to add more vegetables to the soup, consider adding peas, corn, or green beans. Just be sure to add them at the same time as the chicken broth to allow them to cook through.</p><h3 id=6-freezing-and-storing-leftovers>6. <strong>Freezing and Storing Leftovers</strong></h3><p>Instant Pot chicken and dumplings can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. It also freezes well, though the dumplings may lose a bit of their fluffiness after being frozen and reheated. To reheat, simply warm it up in a pot on the stove or in the microwave, adding a little extra broth if necessary.</p><h2 id=why-this-recipe-is-a-game-changer>Why This Recipe is a Game-Changer</h2><p>Making chicken and dumplings in an Instant Pot is not only a time-saver, but it also allows you to achieve the flavors of a long-simmered dish in a fraction of the time.
