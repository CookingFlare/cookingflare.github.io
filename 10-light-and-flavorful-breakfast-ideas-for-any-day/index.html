Greek Yogurt Parfait</h2><p>A Greek yogurt parfait is a versatile breakfast that can be customized to your liking. Start with a base of creamy Greek yogurt—opt for plain to keep added sugars to a minimum. Layer in your choice of fresh fruits, such as berries, sliced bananas, or diced peaches. Add a handful of granola for crunch and drizzle with a touch of honey or maple syrup for sweetness. This colorful breakfast is not only visually appealing but also packed with protein, vitamins, and minerals.</p><h2 id=3-egg-white-and-spinach-omelette>3.
