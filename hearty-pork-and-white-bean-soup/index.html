Here’s what you&rsquo;ll need:</p><ul><li><strong>Pork Shoulder</strong>: 1.5 pounds, trimmed and cut into bite-sized pieces</li><li><strong>White Beans</strong>: 2 cups of dry white beans (such as Great Northern or cannellini beans), soaked overnight or use canned beans for a quicker option (about 4 cups)</li><li><strong>Carrots</strong>: 2 medium carrots, diced</li><li><strong>Celery</strong>: 2 celery stalks, diced</li><li><strong>Onion</strong>: 1 large onion, chopped</li><li><strong>Garlic</strong>: 4 cloves of garlic, minced</li><li><strong>Bay Leaves</strong>: 2 leaves</li><li><strong>Fresh Thyme</strong>: 2 teaspoons of fresh thyme, or 1 teaspoon dried thyme</li><li><strong>Chicken Broth</strong>: 6 cups of low-sodium chicken broth (you can substitute with vegetable broth for a lighter flavor)</li><li><strong>Olive Oil</strong>: 2 tablespoons for sautéing</li><li><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong>: To taste</li><li><strong>Parsley</strong>: Fresh parsley, chopped for garnish</li></ul><p>Optional Ingredients for Extra Flavor:</p><ul><li><strong>Smoked Paprika</strong>: 1 teaspoon for an extra smoky flavor</li><li><strong>Red Pepper Flakes</strong>: A pinch for some mild heat</li><li><strong>Spinach or Kale</strong>: For added greens, throw in a couple of handfuls of fresh spinach or kale near the end of cooking</li></ul><h2 id=step-by-step-guide-to-make-hearty-pork-and-white-bean-soup>Step-by-Step Guide to Make Hearty Pork and White Bean Soup</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-white-beans-if-using-dried-beans>Step 1: Prepare the White Beans (if using dried beans)</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re using dried beans, the first step is to soak them overnight. Place the dried white beans in a large bowl, cover them with water, and let them soak for about 8 hours or overnight. After soaking, drain and rinse them thoroughly before adding them to the soup pot.</p><p>Alternatively, if you’re using canned white beans, you can skip this step and directly add the beans to the soup when instructed.</p><h3 id=step-2-brown-the-pork>Step 2: Brown the Pork</h3><p>In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the pork shoulder pieces in batches. Be careful not to overcrowd the pot, as this can cause the meat to steam rather than brown. Brown the pork on all sides, which should take about 5-7 minutes per batch.</p><p>Once browned, transfer the pork pieces to a plate and set them aside.</p><h3 id=step-3-sauté-vegetables>Step 3: Sauté Vegetables</h3><p>In the same pot, add the chopped onions, carrots, and celery. Sauté the vegetables for about 5-7 minutes, until they start to soften and the onions become translucent. This step adds depth to the flavor of the soup.</p><p>Next, add the minced garlic and cook for another minute, until the garlic becomes fragrant. Be careful not to burn the garlic, as it can become bitter.</p><h3 id=step-4-build-the-soup-base>Step 4: Build the Soup Base</h3><p>Now it&rsquo;s time to add the browned pork back into the pot along with any juices that may have accumulated on the plate. Stir everything together, and then pour in the chicken broth. Stir in the soaked white beans (or canned beans), bay leaves, and thyme.</p><p>Bring the soup to a boil over medium-high heat, and then reduce the heat to low. Let the soup simmer gently for about 1.5 to 2 hours if using dried beans, or 30-45 minutes if you&rsquo;re using canned beans. The goal is to let the beans become tender and for the pork to become melt-in-your-mouth tender.</p><h3 id=step-5-season-and-simmer>Step 5: Season and Simmer</h3><p>Taste the soup and add salt and pepper to your liking. If you like your soup with a little extra smoky depth, you can add a teaspoon of smoked paprika. For a bit of heat, a pinch of red pepper flakes will work wonders, but this step is optional.</p><p>Continue simmering the soup for another 20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. If you&rsquo;re adding spinach or kale, stir in the greens at this point and allow them to wilt into the soup.</p><h3 id=step-6-final-touches>Step 6: Final Touches</h3><p>Once the pork is tender and the beans are fully cooked, remove the soup from the heat. Discard the bay leaves, and give the soup a final taste to adjust the seasoning as needed.</p><p>Ladle the hearty pork and white bean soup into bowls, and garnish with fresh parsley for a burst of color and freshness. If you like a creamy texture, you can use an immersion blender to blend part of the soup or mash a few of the beans, giving it a thicker consistency.</p><h3 id=step-7-serve-and-enjoy>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy!</h3><p>Serve the soup hot with a slice of crusty bread or a warm roll on the side. This <strong>hearty pork and white bean soup</strong> is perfect for a cozy dinner or as a comforting meal to feed a crowd. The combination of tender pork, creamy white beans, and savory broth makes for a dish that feels like a big hug in a bowl.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-best-hearty-pork-and-white-bean-soup>Tips for the Best Hearty Pork and White Bean Soup</h2><h3 id=1-choosing-the-right-pork>1. <strong>Choosing the Right Pork</strong></h3><p>Pork shoulder or pork butt is ideal for this soup because it has the perfect balance of fat and meat. The fat renders down during cooking, making the pork tender and flavorful. If you prefer leaner meat, you could also use pork loin, but it may not have the same richness.</p><h3 id=2-soaking-the-beans>2. <strong>Soaking the Beans</strong></h3><p>If you&rsquo;re using dried beans, soaking them overnight helps reduce cooking time and makes them more digestible. However, if you&rsquo;re in a hurry, you can use the quick-soak method: place the beans in a pot, cover them with water, bring to a boil for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let them sit, covered, for 1 hour.</p><h3 id=3-add-a-smoky-flavor>3. <strong>Add a Smoky Flavor</strong></h3><p>To elevate the depth of flavor, smoked paprika or a small piece of smoked ham can add a delicious smoky undertone to the soup. If you&rsquo;re using smoked ham, add it during the simmering step.</p><h3 id=4-substitute-with-different-beans>4. <strong>Substitute with Different Beans</strong></h3><p>If white beans aren’t your preference, you can substitute them with other beans such as navy beans, pinto beans, or even lentils. Each type of bean will bring its own unique texture and flavor to the soup.</p><h3 id=5-make-ahead-and-store>5. <strong>Make Ahead and Store</strong></h3><p>This soup actually gets better the next day as the flavors continue to develop. If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. It can also be frozen for up to 3 months. When reheating, add a little more broth if the soup has thickened too much.</p><h3 id=6-vegetarian-or-pork-free-version>6. <strong>Vegetarian or Pork-Free Version</strong></h3><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a vegetarian or pork-free version of this soup, you can easily substitute the pork with plant-based sausage or hearty vegetables like mushrooms. Use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth for a completely vegetarian meal.</p><h2 id=why-this-soup-is-so-special>Why This Soup is So Special</h2><p>The combination of pork and white beans creates a satisfying meal that feels substantial but isn&rsquo;t heavy. The <strong>pork shoulder</strong> provides richness and a deep, savory flavor, while the <strong>white beans</strong> contribute creaminess and texture. Together, they create a balanced dish that’s perfect for a cozy night in.</p><p>In addition to its flavor, this soup is also packed with protein and fiber, making it a filling and healthy meal.
