Prepare the Vegetables</h3><p>The first step to making a vegetable lasagna is to cook the vegetables, which will form the hearty filling of your dish. Start by heating the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, sautéing for 2-3 minutes until they’re soft and fragrant.</p><p>Next, add the sliced zucchini, bell pepper, and mushrooms to the skillet. Stir occasionally, cooking for about 5-7 minutes until the vegetables are tender and any moisture from the mushrooms has evaporated. Finally, add the chopped spinach, cooking for an additional 1-2 minutes until wilted. Season with salt, pepper, oregano, and basil. Once the vegetables are cooked, remove from heat and set aside to cool slightly.</p><p>In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. Once the vegetables have cooled, gently fold them into the cheese mixture, creating a creamy and flavorful filling for your lasagna.</p><h3 id=2-make-the-tomato-sauce>2. Make the Tomato Sauce</h3><p>For a rich and flavorful tomato sauce, combine the marinara sauce, crushed tomatoes, and tomato paste in a medium saucepan. Stir to combine. Season with salt, pepper, red pepper flakes (if using), and sugar (if using to reduce acidity). Simmer the sauce over low heat for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Once done, remove from heat and set aside.</p><h3 id=3-assemble-the-lasagna>3. Assemble the Lasagna</h3><p>Now comes the fun part: assembling the lasagna. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C) and lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Begin by spreading a thin layer of the tomato sauce on the bottom of the dish. This will prevent the lasagna from sticking and add an extra layer of flavor.</p><p>Place 3-4 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Since you&rsquo;re using no-boil noodles, make sure they’re spread evenly to cover the base. Next, spread one-third of the vegetable and cheese mixture evenly over the noodles. Then, add another layer of sauce, followed by a sprinkling of mozzarella cheese.</p><p>Repeat the process for two more layers, ensuring each layer is well spread and balanced. After the final layer of vegetables and sauce, sprinkle the remaining mozzarella cheese on top, along with any remaining Parmesan for extra flavor.</p><h3 id=4-bake-the-lasagna>4. Bake the Lasagna</h3><p>Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil, making sure it doesn’t touch the cheese on top. This will help keep the lasagna moist as it bakes. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</p><h3 id=5-let-it-rest-and-serve>5. Let it Rest and Serve</h3><p>Once the lasagna is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it rest for at least 10 minutes. This helps the layers set, making it easier to cut and serve. Garnish with fresh basil or parsley, if desired.</p><p>Slice into squares, and enjoy your delicious and comforting vegetable lasagna!</p><h2 id=tips-for-making-the-best-vegetable-lasagna>Tips for Making the Best Vegetable Lasagna</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Use Fresh Vegetables:</strong> For the best flavor and texture, always use fresh vegetables. While frozen vegetables can work in a pinch, fresh vegetables retain their shape and add a much more vibrant taste to the dish.</p></li><li><p><strong>Layer Generously:</strong> Don’t skimp on the layers. The more veggies, cheese, and sauce you add, the richer the flavors will be. Each bite should have a satisfying mix of textures.</p></li><li><p><strong>Consider Additional Vegetables:</strong> Feel free to mix and match vegetables based on what you have on hand. Eggplant, sweet potatoes, or even carrots would make great additions to this lasagna.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it Ahead:</strong> Vegetable lasagna can be assembled ahead of time and stored in the fridge for up to 24 hours before baking. This is perfect for meal prepping or preparing for a busy day.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it Vegan:</strong> To make this lasagna vegan, simply swap the ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan for plant-based versions. There are many great dairy-free cheese options available that melt just like traditional cheese.</p></li><li><p><strong>Freeze for Later:</strong> This lasagna freezes well! After baking, let it cool completely, then cover it tightly with foil and freeze for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply thaw overnight in the fridge and bake at 350°F (175°C) for 30-40 minutes, or until heated through.</p></li></ul><h2 id=why-this-recipe-is-a-family-favorite>Why This Recipe is a Family Favorite</h2><p>One of the reasons vegetable lasagna is such a beloved dish is because it’s a meal everyone can enjoy.
