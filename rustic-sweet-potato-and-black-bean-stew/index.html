With just a few steps, you’ll have a pot of delicious stew to enjoy in no time. Here’s how to do it:</p><h4 id=step-1-prepare-the-vegetables>Step 1: Prepare the Vegetables</h4><p>Start by peeling and cubing the sweet potatoes into bite-sized pieces. Set them aside in a bowl. Dice the onion and mince the garlic cloves, as well. These ingredients will form the aromatic base of the stew, so prepping them ahead of time helps streamline the cooking process.</p><h4 id=step-2-sauté-the-aromatics>Step 2: Sauté the Aromatics</h4><p>Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the diced onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes or until the onion becomes translucent and soft. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute, stirring constantly to avoid burning the garlic. The kitchen will already start to smell amazing at this point.</p><h4 id=step-3-cook-the-spices>Step 3: Cook the Spices</h4><p>Next, add the ground cumin, smoked paprika, and ground coriander to the pot. Stir the spices into the onions and garlic, allowing them to bloom in the heat for about 1 minute. This step releases the full flavors of the spices, which will enhance the overall taste of the stew.</p><h4 id=step-4-add-the-sweet-potatoes-beans-and-tomatoes>Step 4: Add the Sweet Potatoes, Beans, and Tomatoes</h4><p>Now it’s time to add the star ingredients. Add the cubed sweet potatoes to the pot, followed by the black beans, diced tomatoes (with their juices), and vegetable broth. Stir everything together to combine.</p><h4 id=step-5-simmer-to-perfection>Step 5: Simmer to Perfection</h4><p>Bring the stew to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let the stew simmer for about 25-30 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender. The broth should be flavorful and slightly thickened, creating a cozy and satisfying texture.</p><h4 id=step-6-final-seasoning>Step 6: Final Seasoning</h4><p>Once the stew is done cooking, taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. You may want to add a little more salt, pepper, or spices depending on your taste preferences. If you like a little more heat, you can stir in some red pepper flakes or chopped fresh chili peppers.</p><h4 id=step-7-serve-and-garnish>Step 7: Serve and Garnish</h4><p>Ladle the stew into bowls and garnish with freshly chopped cilantro. For an added burst of flavor, serve the stew with a lime wedge on the side. A squeeze of lime just before eating adds a refreshing contrast to the richness of the stew.</p><h3 id=tips-for-customizing-your-stew>Tips for Customizing Your Stew</h3><p>While this rustic sweet potato and black bean stew is absolutely delicious as is, there are plenty of ways to personalize it based on what you have on hand or your taste preferences.</p><ul><li><strong>Add More Vegetables</strong>: Feel free to add other vegetables like carrots, bell peppers, zucchini, or spinach to the stew. These ingredients add color, texture, and additional nutrients.</li><li><strong>Spicy Kick</strong>: If you enjoy spicy food, consider adding diced jalapeños, serrano peppers, or even a dash of hot sauce to give the stew an extra layer of heat.</li><li><strong>Top with Avocado</strong>: A creamy avocado topping can make the stew even richer and add a lovely texture contrast.</li><li><strong>Make It a Main Dish</strong>: While this stew is already filling, you can serve it alongside a grain like quinoa, brown rice, or a slice of crusty bread for a more substantial meal.</li><li><strong>Add Coconut Milk</strong>: For a creamier texture and a hint of tropical sweetness, you can stir in a can of coconut milk about halfway through the cooking process.</li></ul><h3 id=how-to-store-and-reheat>How to Store and Reheat</h3><p>This stew keeps wonderfully in the refrigerator, making it a great make-ahead meal or meal prep option. After it has cooled to room temperature, store the stew in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. To reheat, simply warm it up in a pot over medium heat, stirring occasionally. If it’s too thick, you can thin it out with a bit of extra vegetable broth or water.</p><p>This stew also freezes well. Let it cool completely before transferring it to a freezer-safe container. It can be frozen for up to 3 months. To reheat from frozen, either thaw it overnight in the fridge or heat it on the stovetop over low heat, adding a little extra liquid if needed.</p><h3 id=why-sweet-potatoes-and-black-beans>Why Sweet Potatoes and Black Beans?</h3><p>Sweet potatoes and black beans are a perfect pairing, not just for flavor, but for their combined nutritional benefits.
