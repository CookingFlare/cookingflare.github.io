Middle Eastern cuisine, with its rich flavors, fresh ingredients, and exciting combinations, is an excellent choice for any occasion. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for vegetarian delights, meat-based treats, or flavorful dips to complement your drinks, there is something for everyone in the Middle Eastern appetizer repertoire.</p><p>In this post, we will explore the best Middle Eastern appetizers that will leave your guests talking long after the party ends. From creamy hummus and crispy falafel to aromatic kebabs and vibrant salads, these appetizers are perfect for impressing your guests while providing an authentic taste of the Middle East.</p><h2 id=1-hummus>1. Hummus</h2><p>Hummus is perhaps the most iconic Middle Eastern appetizer, beloved worldwide for its creamy texture and rich flavor. It is made from pureed chickpeas, tahini (sesame paste), garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil, resulting in a velvety smooth dip that pairs perfectly with pita bread, fresh vegetables, or crackers.</p><h3 id=variations-of-hummus>Variations of Hummus</h3><p>While classic hummus is a crowd-pleaser, you can elevate this dish by offering variations to cater to different tastes. For example:</p><ul><li><strong>Roasted Red Pepper Hummus</strong>: Add roasted red peppers to the mix for a smoky, slightly sweet flavor.</li><li><strong>Spicy Hummus</strong>: Incorporate harissa, a North African chili paste, for a fiery kick.</li><li><strong>Beetroot Hummus</strong>: Blend in roasted beets for a beautiful pink color and earthy sweetness.</li></ul><p>Regardless of the flavor variation you choose, hummus will be a hit at your party.</p><h2 id=2-falafel>2. Falafel</h2><p>Falafel is a popular vegetarian Middle Eastern snack made from ground chickpeas (or fava beans), herbs, and spices, then deep-fried to perfection. These crispy, golden-brown balls of goodness are bursting with flavor and offer a delightful crunch on the outside, while remaining soft and flavorful on the inside.</p><h3 id=how-to-serve-falafel>How to Serve Falafel</h3><p>You can serve falafel on its own with a side of tahini sauce, or you can get creative by incorporating them into a pita or flatbread with a variety of toppings like lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, pickles, and more. You can also serve falafel with a refreshing yogurt-based dip for an extra layer of flavor.</p><p>Falafel is not just for vegetarians—everyone will love the hearty and satisfying bite that falafel provides.</p><h2 id=3-baba-ganoush>3. Baba Ganoush</h2><p>Baba ganoush is a smoky eggplant dip that has a similar texture and purpose to hummus. The eggplant is roasted until the skin is charred and the flesh becomes tender, then it is mashed and mixed with tahini, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil. The result is a creamy, velvety dip with a subtle smokiness from the roasted eggplant.</p><h3 id=how-to-serve-baba-ganoush>How to Serve Baba Ganoush</h3><p>Baba ganoush is typically served with warm pita bread, but it can also be served with fresh vegetables like cucumber, carrots, or bell peppers for dipping. Its flavor pairs wonderfully with a glass of chilled white wine or a refreshing iced tea.</p><p>For a modern twist, you can even use baba ganoush as a spread for sandwiches or wraps, adding a delicious Middle Eastern flavor to any dish.</p><h2 id=4-stuffed-grape-leaves-dolma>4. Stuffed Grape Leaves (Dolma)</h2><p>Dolma is a traditional Middle Eastern appetizer consisting of vine leaves stuffed with a mixture of rice, pine nuts, and herbs, sometimes with ground meat added for extra flavor. The stuffed grape leaves are rolled tightly and then simmered in a fragrant broth, making them incredibly aromatic and full of flavor.</p><h3 id=vegetarian-vs-meat-filled-dolma>Vegetarian vs. Meat-Filled Dolma</h3><p>While the classic version of dolma is often vegetarian, filled with rice, onions, and herbs, you can also find meat-filled versions that include ground lamb or beef. The combination of herbs like dill, mint, and parsley provides a fresh and vibrant flavor that contrasts wonderfully with the earthy taste of the grape leaves.</p><p>Dolma is typically served chilled or at room temperature, making it an easy and convenient option for a party. Garnish with a squeeze of lemon for an added burst of freshness.</p><h2 id=5-fattoush>5. Fattoush</h2><p>Fattoush is a Middle Eastern salad made from mixed greens, cucumbers, tomatoes, radishes, and crispy pieces of fried pita bread. The salad is dressed with a tangy vinaigrette made from olive oil, lemon juice, and sumac, a tangy, slightly sour spice that adds a distinctive flavor to the dish.</p><h3 id=why-fattoush-works-for-parties>Why Fattoush Works for Parties</h3><p>This vibrant salad is refreshing and light, providing a nice contrast to heavier appetizers. The crispy pita bread adds texture, while the sumac dressing gives the salad a zesty kick that will awaken your taste buds. Fattoush is a great option for parties because it can be prepared in advance, and it’s served cold, which means less work for the host right before the event.</p><h2 id=6-shawarma-skewers>6. Shawarma Skewers</h2><p>Shawarma is a beloved Middle Eastern dish typically made with seasoned lamb, chicken, or beef that is cooked on a vertical rotisserie. For a party setting, you can serve shawarma in smaller portions by skewering the meat and grilling it to perfection. Shawarma skewers are juicy, flavorful, and ideal for serving as an appetizer.</p><h3 id=shawarma-marinade>Shawarma Marinade</h3><p>The key to a great shawarma is in the marinade. A traditional shawarma marinade often includes garlic, yogurt, lemon juice, cumin, paprika, turmeric, and cinnamon, creating a tender and flavorful meat that is aromatic and savory.</p><p>You can serve shawarma skewers with a side of garlic sauce or tahini, and for a complete experience, offer some flatbreads, pickles, and a few fresh salads. Your guests will be asking for the recipe!</p><h2 id=7-labneh>7. Labneh</h2><p>Labneh is a Middle Eastern yogurt cheese that has a creamy, spreadable texture and a tangy flavor. It’s made by straining yogurt to remove excess whey, resulting in a thick and rich product. Labneh can be served on its own, drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with herbs and spices, or used as a dip with pita or vegetables.</p><h3 id=how-to-make-labneh>How to Make Labneh</h3><p>Making labneh at home is surprisingly simple. All you need is plain, full-fat yogurt, a fine mesh strainer, and some cheesecloth. The yogurt is left to drain for several hours or overnight to achieve the desired consistency. Once you have your labneh, drizzle it with olive oil, and sprinkle it with za’atar (a Middle Eastern spice blend) or sumac for an added flavor boost.</p><p>Labneh is a versatile appetizer that can be served in a variety of ways, making it perfect for any gathering.</p><h2 id=8-muhamarra>8. Muhamarra</h2><p>Muhamarra is a vibrant red pepper and walnut dip that hails from Syria. It has a slightly spicy, smoky flavor thanks to the roasted red peppers, and the ground walnuts add richness and texture to the dip. Olive oil, garlic, and pomegranate molasses give the dip an earthy sweetness that balances out the spiciness.</p><h3 id=how-to-serve-muhamarra>How to Serve Muhamarra</h3><p>Muhamarra is typically served with pita bread or crackers, but it can also be used as a spread on sandwiches or wraps. Its bold flavors make it a wonderful accompaniment to other Middle Eastern appetizers, providing a contrast to lighter dips like hummus or baba ganoush.</p><h2 id=9-sambousek>9. Sambousek</h2><p>Sambousek are savory pastries that are stuffed with a variety of fillings, including spiced meat, cheese, or vegetables. These crispy, golden pockets are perfect finger foods, making them ideal for party appetizers.

The dough is rolled out, topped with your choice of ingredients, and then baked until golden and crispy.</p><h3 id=variations-of-manakish>Variations of Manakish</h3><ul><li><strong>Za’atar Manakish</strong>: The most traditional version, topped with a mix of za’atar, olive oil, and sometimes a sprinkle of cheese.</li><li><strong>Cheese Manakish</strong>: A cheesy, gooey version that combines mozzarella and feta for a mouthwatering treat.</li><li><strong>Meat Manakish</strong>: Minced lamb or beef mixed with onions, spices, and tomatoes, then baked to perfection.</li></ul><p>Manakish is perfect for a more substantial appetizer or even as a meal on its own.
