The tartness of rhubarb beautifully balances the sweet juiciness of ripe strawberries, creating a delicious, spreadable treat that’s perfect for toast, pastries, or as a topping for your favorite desserts. But there’s more to strawberry rhubarb jam than just the recipe. In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know to make and can your own strawberry rhubarb jam. Whether you&rsquo;re a first-time jam maker or a seasoned canner, we’ve got you covered!</p><h2 id=why-make-strawberry-rhubarb-jam>Why Make Strawberry Rhubarb Jam?</h2><p>Strawberry rhubarb jam is not only delicious but also a great way to preserve the flavors of spring and summer. Rhubarb has a short growing season, and by combining it with strawberries, you can create a vibrant jam that captures the essence of both fruits. By making your own jam at home, you also get the added benefit of controlling the ingredients—no artificial preservatives or added sugars that often show up in store-bought jams.</p><h2 id=ingredients-for-strawberry-rhubarb-jam>Ingredients for Strawberry Rhubarb Jam</h2><p>To make strawberry rhubarb jam, you’ll need fresh, high-quality ingredients. Here’s what you’ll need:</p><h3 id=basic-ingredients>Basic Ingredients:</h3><ul><li><strong>4 cups fresh strawberries</strong> (hulled and chopped)</li><li><strong>4 cups fresh rhubarb</strong> (chopped)</li><li><strong>5 cups granulated sugar</strong></li><li><strong>1/4 cup lemon juice</strong> (freshly squeezed)</li><li><strong>1 packet pectin</strong> (look for powdered pectin, such as Sure-Jell, that is specifically designed for jam making)</li></ul><h3 id=optional-ingredients>Optional Ingredients:</h3><ul><li><strong>1/2 tsp cinnamon</strong> (for a warm undertone)</li><li><strong>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</strong> (adds depth to the flavor)</li><li><strong>1/2 cup water</strong> (to help with cooking if needed)</li></ul><h3 id=equipment-needed>Equipment Needed:</h3><ul><li>Large heavy-bottomed pot</li><li>Wooden spoon or heatproof spatula</li><li>Ladle</li><li>Canning jars (at least 4-6 half-pint jars)</li><li>Lids and bands for canning</li><li>Canning funnel (optional but helpful)</li><li>Jar tongs (for safety when handling hot jars)</li><li>Large canning pot with rack or a deep stockpot for boiling jars</li></ul><h2 id=step-by-step-guide-how-to-make-strawberry-rhubarb-jam>Step-by-Step Guide: How to Make Strawberry Rhubarb Jam</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-fruit>Step 1: Prepare the Fruit</h3><p>Start by preparing your strawberries and rhubarb. First, hull the strawberries and chop them into small pieces. You want the pieces small enough to break down during the cooking process but not so small that they disappear completely.</p><p>For the rhubarb, remove any tough outer strings by peeling them gently with a vegetable peeler. Then chop the rhubarb stalks into small pieces as well. The rhubarb will break down into a soft texture as it cooks, so there’s no need to worry about uniformity.</p><h3 id=step-2-cook-the-fruit>Step 2: Cook the Fruit</h3><p>Place the chopped strawberries and rhubarb into your large, heavy-bottomed pot. Add the lemon juice and stir. The lemon juice not only adds a nice tang but also helps the pectin set, ensuring your jam will gel properly.</p><p>If you’re using cinnamon or vanilla extract, you can add these now, too. They’ll infuse the jam with their flavors while it cooks. Stir everything together to combine.</p><p>At this point, you have two options:</p><ol><li>You can cook the fruit over medium heat, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes until the fruit begins to break down and soften.</li><li>Alternatively, you can use a potato masher to mash the fruit as it cooks. This gives you more control over the texture of the jam, allowing you to leave some larger chunks for a more rustic jam or mash it completely for a smoother consistency.</li></ol><h3 id=step-3-add-sugar-and-pectin>Step 3: Add Sugar and Pectin</h3><p>Once the fruit mixture is softened to your liking, it’s time to add the sugar. Add the granulated sugar into the pot and stir until it’s completely dissolved. This step is crucial to ensure the jam has the right consistency.</p><p>Now, sprinkle the pectin over the fruit-sugar mixture. Stir it in thoroughly, making sure that the pectin is evenly distributed. Pectin is what helps the jam set, so don’t skip this step!</p><h3 id=step-4-boil-the-jam>Step 4: Boil the Jam</h3><p>Bring the mixture to a rolling boil over medium-high heat. Keep stirring constantly to prevent the fruit from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Allow the mixture to boil for about 5-10 minutes, or until it thickens. You’ll know it’s ready when it coats the back of a spoon and you can draw a line through it with your finger.</p><p>If you’re unsure whether the jam is ready, you can test it using the “freezer test.” Simply place a small plate in the freezer before starting the jam-making process. When you think the jam has thickened, spoon a small amount onto the chilled plate and return it to the freezer for about 1 minute. Run your finger through the jam. If it wrinkles and holds its shape, it’s done!</p><h3 id=step-5-skim-off-foam>Step 5: Skim off Foam</h3><p>Once the jam has reached the desired thickness, remove the pot from the heat. You’ll notice some foam on top of the jam. Use a spoon to skim off the foam and discard it. This step is optional but will give your jam a smoother texture and a cleaner look when it’s finished.</p><h3 id=step-6-can-the-jam>Step 6: Can the Jam</h3><p>Now that your strawberry rhubarb jam is cooked, it’s time to can it. This step will allow you to store the jam safely for months. Begin by sterilizing your canning jars. Place the jars in a large pot of boiling water for 10-15 minutes to ensure they are sanitized. Let the jars air dry completely.</p><p>Once your jars are ready, carefully ladle the hot jam into the jars. Leave about 1/4 inch of headspace at the top of each jar. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe the rims of the jars to remove any residue or jam that could prevent the jars from sealing properly.</p><p>Place the lids on the jars and screw on the canning bands until they are snug but not overly tight. Using tongs, carefully lower the jars into a canning pot or a large stockpot filled with hot water. The water should cover the jars by at least an inch.</p><p>Bring the water to a boil and process the jars for 10 minutes. After processing, carefully remove the jars from the water and place them on a clean towel to cool. You should hear a “pop” as the jars seal. This indicates that the jars are sealed properly.</p><h3 id=step-7-store-your-jam>Step 7: Store Your Jam</h3><p>Allow the jars to cool completely, which may take several hours. Once cooled, check the seals by pressing down in the center of each lid. If the lid doesn’t pop back, the jar is sealed correctly. If it pops back, the jar didn’t seal, and you’ll need to refrigerate it and use it within a few weeks.</p><p>Store sealed jars in a cool, dark place for up to a year. If you don’t have space to store your jam in a pantry, consider placing it in a cellar or any other cool, dry area. Unsealed jars should be refrigerated and consumed within a few weeks.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-best-strawberry-rhubarb-jam>Tips for the Best Strawberry Rhubarb Jam</h2><ul><li><strong>Use ripe fruit</strong>: For the best flavor, make sure your strawberries are perfectly ripe. Overripe strawberries will produce a jam with an overly mushy texture, while underripe strawberries might result in a more tart jam.</li><li><strong>Don’t skip the pectin</strong>: Pectin is the key to getting your jam to set properly. If you’re new to canning, it’s worth sticking to the recommended type of pectin to avoid any potential issues.</li><li><strong>Test for consistency</strong>: If you like your jam a bit firmer, you can extend the boiling time slightly, but be cautious not to overcook it, as this can make the jam too thick or candy-like.</li><li><strong>Experiment with flavor</strong>: Feel free to experiment with adding other flavorings to your jam, such as a splash of balsamic vinegar for depth or some fresh mint for a refreshing twist.</li><li><strong>Use a heavy-bottomed pot</strong>: When making jam, it’s important to use a pot with a thick base. This helps prevent burning and ensures the fruit cooks evenly.</li></ul><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Making strawberry rhubarb jam at home is a satisfying and rewarding process. The combination of sweet strawberries and tart rhubarb creates a jam that’s bursting with flavor. Whether you’re enjoying it on toast, using it in desserts, or simply sharing it with friends and family, homemade strawberry rhubarb jam is a treat everyone will love. With a bit of patience and the right technique, you can easily preserve the flavors of spring for months to come.</p><p>So, roll up your sleeves, gather your ingredients, and get ready to make your own batch of this delicious jam.
