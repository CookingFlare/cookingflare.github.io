Once the beans are clean, rinse them thoroughly under cold water.</p><p>Now, place the beans in a large pot and cover them with water. Allow them to soak for at least 8 hours or overnight. If you&rsquo;re short on time, you can use the quick-soak method by bringing the beans to a boil for about 2 minutes, then turning off the heat and letting them sit for an hour. After soaking, drain and rinse the beans again before cooking.</p><h3 id=step-2-sauté-the-vegetables>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3><p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat a generous amount of olive oil over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the diced onions and sauté until they become soft and translucent. This will take about 5-7 minutes.</p><p>Next, add the garlic, carrots, and celery to the pot. Stir the vegetables for another 5 minutes until they begin to soften and release their aromas.</p><h3 id=step-3-add-the-tomatoes>Step 3: Add the Tomatoes</h3><p>Now, it’s time to add the tomatoes. If you’re using fresh tomatoes, chop them roughly and add them to the pot. If you’re using canned tomatoes, crush them with your hands or use a spoon to break them up. Add the tomato paste at this stage if you’re using it. Stir everything together, allowing the tomatoes to cook down and become slightly saucy, about 10 minutes.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-the-beans-and-simmer>Step 4: Add the Beans and Simmer</h3><p>Once the tomato mixture has cooked down, add the soaked beans to the pot. Pour in enough water to cover the beans by a few inches. Add the bay leaves, salt, and pepper, then stir everything together. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Let the soup simmer gently for about 1-1.5 hours or until the beans are tender and have absorbed the flavors of the broth.</p><h3 id=step-5-adjust-the-seasoning>Step 5: Adjust the Seasoning</h3><p>As the soup simmers, check the consistency of the broth. If it becomes too thick, add more water or vegetable broth to thin it out. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper, or oregano if needed.</p><h3 id=step-6-final-touches>Step 6: Final Touches</h3><p>Once the beans are tender, remove the pot from the heat. If you’re using fresh parsley, chop it finely and stir it into the soup for added freshness. A squeeze of lemon juice just before serving will brighten the flavors even more.</p><h3 id=step-7-serve>Step 7: Serve</h3><p>Ladle the Fasolada into bowls and drizzle a bit of extra virgin olive oil on top for a rich finish. Some people like to serve their Fasolada with a slice of crusty bread to soak up the delicious broth. Enjoy this flavorful and comforting Greek soup!</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-perfect-fasolada>Tips for the Perfect Fasolada</h2><ul><li><strong>Use high-quality olive oil</strong>: Since olive oil is the primary fat in Fasolada, using good-quality extra virgin olive oil will enhance the overall flavor of the soup.</li><li><strong>Soak the beans properly</strong>: For the best texture, ensure the beans are soaked long enough to soften and cook evenly.</li><li><strong>Don’t rush the simmering process</strong>: Fasolada requires a long, slow simmer to allow the beans to fully absorb the flavors of the broth. Be patient and let the soup cook at its own pace.</li><li><strong>Customize the soup</strong>: While Fasolada is traditionally made with a simple combination of vegetables and beans, feel free to get creative. You can add other vegetables like bell peppers or zucchini, or even stir in some cooked pasta for added substance.</li></ul><h2 id=health-benefits-of-fasolada>Health Benefits of Fasolada</h2><p>Fasolada is not only delicious but also incredibly nutritious. Beans are packed with protein, fiber, and essential vitamins and minerals, making this soup a great option for vegetarians and vegans. The olive oil provides heart-healthy fats, while the tomatoes are rich in antioxidants like lycopene. The vegetables in the soup add essential vitamins, and the herbs bring additional health benefits.</p><p>This simple yet satisfying meal is full of healthy ingredients that will keep you feeling nourished and satisfied.</p><h2 id=variations-of-fasolada>Variations of Fasolada</h2><p>While the basic Fasolada recipe remains largely unchanged, there are a few variations depending on the region of Greece. For example, some variations include the use of spinach or other greens, while others may add more spices or even small pasta shapes for a more filling dish.</p><p>One variation of Fasolada includes the addition of <strong>olives</strong> or <strong>feta cheese</strong> on top, which can add a delightful tanginess that complements the soup’s savory flavors. You can also experiment with <strong>oregano</strong> and <strong>thyme</strong>, two herbs that are commonly used in Greek cooking.</p><h2 id=fasolada-around-the-world>Fasolada Around the World</h2><p>Although Fasolada is a traditional Greek dish, its simplicity and nourishing qualities have led to its popularity in other parts of the world. Variations of bean soups with similar ingredients are found in many Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisines. In Turkey, for instance, there’s a similar bean soup known as &ldquo;Kuru Fasulye,&rdquo; and in Italy, bean soups with tomatoes and olive oil are equally beloved.</p><p>No matter where you are in the world, Fasolada is a comforting dish that brings people together.
