Whether you're from the region or just a lover of Eastern European cuisine, these 5 dishes are sure to become a staple in your kitchen.
Potato Pancakes with Apple and Sour Cream (Latkes)
Latkes are a classic Eastern European dish that originated in Poland and Ukraine. These crispy potato pancakes are typically served with a dollop of sour cream and a side of applesauce. The combination of textures and flavors will leave you wanting more. The key to a great latke is using the right balance of grated potatoes and onions, along with a touch of salt and pepper to enhance the flavor.
To make latkes, start by grating 2 large potatoes using the large side of a box grater. Add 1/2 cup of grated onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic. In a large bowl, beat 1 egg and mix in 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour. Add the grated potato mixture and stir until well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Heat 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Using a 1/4 cup measuring cup, scoop the potato mixture into the oil and flatten slightly with a spatula. Cook for 4-5 minutes or until the latkes are golden brown and crispy. Flip and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes or until golden brown.
Polish Soup (Zurek)
Zurek, or Polish soup, is a comforting and hearty dish made with sour rye flour, served with a Polish sausage called kielbasa and a side of boiled eggs and pickles. The key to a great zurek is using a combination of pork and beef sausage for added flavor.
To make zurek, start by combining 2 cups of rye flour, 1/2 cup of dried rye grains, and 1 tablespoon of caraway seeds in a large bowl. Add 1 cup of warm water and mix until the dough is smooth and elastic. Knead the dough for 10-15 minutes until it's smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour.
While the dough is rising, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1/2 cup of sliced pork sausage and cook until browned, breaking up the meat with a spoon as it cooks. Add 1 tablespoon of tomato paste and 1 cup of beef broth. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for 5-7 minutes or until the mixture thickens.
Hungarian Chicken Paprikash
Chicken Paprikash, or csurgatta, is a Hungarian dish that originated in the Puszta region. This hearty soup is made with chicken, smoked paprika, and sour cream, and is typically served with a side of egg noodles. The dish is flavored with a combination of onions, garlic, and pepper.
To make chicken paprikash, start by heating 2 tablespoons of oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add 1 onion, thinly sliced, and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Add 2 cloves of garlic, minced, and cook for an additional minute.
Add 1 pound of chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces, and cook until browned, about 5-7 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon of caraway seeds, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Stir to combine.
Next, add 2 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of sour cream to the pot. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes or until the chicken is tender. Serve the paprikash over cooked egg noodles.
Czech Goulash with Dumplings
Goulash is a Czech dish made with beef, soup, and dumplings. The dish originated in Hungary, but the Czechs have added their own twist with the addition of dumplings, called knedlíky. The knedlíky are typically made with a combination of flour, eggs, and milk, and are served with a side of sour cream.
To make the goulash, start by heating 2 tablespoons of oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add 1 onion, thinly sliced, and cook until softened, about 5-7 minutes. Add 2 cloves of garlic, minced, and cook for an additional minute.
Add 1 pound of beef, cut into bite-sized pieces, and cook until browned, about 5-7 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of tomato paste and 1 cup of beef broth. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook for 10-15 minutes or until the beef is tender.
Buckwheat Blini with Caramelized Onions and Sour Cream
Blintzy or bliny are a Russian dish that consists of thin pancakes made with buckwheat flour. The pancakes are typically served with a side of caramelized onions and sour cream. The combination of textures and flavors is both sweet and savory.
To make buckwheat blini, start by mixing 1 cup of buckwheat flour and 1 cup of all-purpose flour in a large bowl. Add 1 egg and 1/4 cup of warm water and mix until a smooth batter forms. Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and drop the batter by 1/4 cupfuls into the skillet. Cook for 1-2 minutes or until the blini are golden brown and crispy. Flip and cook for an additional 30 seconds.
While the blini are cooking, caramelize 1 large onion by heating 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Cook the onion for 20-25 minutes or until softened and dark golden brown.
To assemble the dish, place a blini on a plate, top it with a dollop of sour cream, and a spoonful of caramelized onions.
