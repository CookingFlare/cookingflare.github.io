This recipe serves 4 people and requires the following:</p><h3 id=main-ingredients>Main Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>2 ½ pounds (1.1 kg) of beef short ribs (preferably bone-in)</li><li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li><li>5-6 garlic cloves, minced</li><li>1-inch piece of ginger, minced</li><li>2 medium-sized onions, sliced</li><li>1 carrot, cut into chunks</li><li>2-3 stalks of green onions, chopped (for garnish)</li></ul><h3 id=marinade-and-braising-sauce>Marinade and Braising Sauce:</h3><ul><li>½ cup soy sauce</li><li>¼ cup brown sugar (or white sugar)</li><li>¼ cup rice wine (or mirin)</li><li>1 tablespoon honey</li><li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li><li>1 tablespoon grated ginger</li><li>1 tablespoon garlic paste (or minced garlic)</li><li>1 pear (preferably Korean pear), grated (adds natural sweetness and tenderizes the meat)</li><li>1 tablespoon gochugaru (Korean chili flakes) – optional, for some spice</li><li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li><li>1 ½ cups water or beef broth</li><li>1-2 tablespoons corn starch mixed with water (to thicken the sauce, optional)</li></ul><h2 id=preparing-galbi-jjim>Preparing Galbi Jjim</h2><h3 id=step-1-preparing-the-beef-short-ribs>Step 1: Preparing the Beef Short Ribs</h3><p>First, you’ll want to prepare the short ribs to ensure they’re clean and ready to absorb all the wonderful flavors of the braising liquid.</p><ol><li><strong>Soak the short ribs</strong>: Place the beef short ribs in a large bowl of cold water and soak them for at least 30 minutes. This step helps to remove excess blood, ensuring the braised short ribs come out tender and clean. If you have more time, soaking for up to 1 hour will give even better results.</li><li>After soaking, <strong>drain the short ribs</strong> and pat them dry with paper towels to remove any excess water.</li></ol><h3 id=step-2-marinating-the-short-ribs>Step 2: Marinating the Short Ribs</h3><p>To make the short ribs extra tender and flavorful, marinate them in a mixture of <strong>soy sauce</strong>, <strong>brown sugar</strong>, <strong>rice wine</strong>, <strong>honey</strong>, and <strong>ginger</strong>. This marinade is what gives the dish its characteristic sweet and savory taste.</p><ol><li><strong>Make the marinade</strong>: In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, rice wine, honey, sesame oil, grated ginger, minced garlic, and the grated pear. The pear acts as a natural tenderizer, ensuring the meat becomes fall-off-the-bone tender.</li><li><strong>Add the short ribs</strong>: Place the soaked and patted dry beef short ribs into the marinade. Mix them around to ensure the short ribs are fully coated in the marinade. Allow the short ribs to marinate for at least 1 hour in the refrigerator. If you have more time, marinating them for 4-6 hours or even overnight will result in a richer, deeper flavor.</li></ol><h3 id=step-3-preparing-the-braise>Step 3: Preparing the Braise</h3><p>Once the short ribs have marinated, it’s time to begin the braising process. This step involves slowly cooking the short ribs in a flavorful liquid until the meat is tender and succulent.</p><ol><li><strong>Heat the sesame oil</strong>: In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat about 1 tablespoon of sesame oil over medium-high heat. The oil will provide a subtle nutty flavor to the dish and help sear the meat.</li><li><strong>Sear the short ribs</strong>: Add the marinated short ribs to the pot and sear them on all sides until they are lightly browned. This step adds depth to the flavor and helps lock in the juices. It should take about 5-6 minutes to sear the short ribs evenly. Once seared, remove the short ribs and set them aside.</li></ol><h3 id=step-4-braising-the-short-ribs>Step 4: Braising the Short Ribs</h3><p>Now, it’s time to let the short ribs slow-cook in their flavorful braising liquid. This will take time, but the result is a dish that practically melts in your mouth.</p><ol><li><strong>Prepare the braising liquid</strong>: In the same pot, add the sliced onions, carrots, and any leftover marinade from the short ribs. Stir for a minute or two, allowing the vegetables to soften and the flavors to combine.</li><li><strong>Add water or broth</strong>: Pour in about 1 ½ cups of water or beef broth. If you prefer a richer flavor, beef broth is a great choice. Bring the liquid to a gentle boil.</li><li><strong>Add the short ribs back in</strong>: Once the braising liquid begins to boil, return the short ribs to the pot. The short ribs should be submerged in the liquid. If needed, add more water or broth to cover the meat.</li><li><strong>Simmer</strong>: Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the short ribs braise for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally to ensure the meat is evenly cooked and tender. You’ll know the ribs are ready when the meat is fork-tender and easily pulls away from the bone.</li></ol><h3 id=step-5-finishing-the-dish>Step 5: Finishing the Dish</h3><p>Once the short ribs are perfectly braised, it’s time to finish the dish and bring it all together.</p><ol><li><strong>Thicken the sauce (optional)</strong>: If you prefer a thicker sauce, you can create a slurry by mixing 1-2 tablespoons of cornstarch with a small amount of water and adding it to the braising liquid. Stir continuously until the sauce thickens to your liking.</li><li><strong>Adjust the seasoning</strong>: Taste the sauce and adjust the flavor if needed. If it’s too salty, add a little more sugar or honey. If it’s too sweet, a dash of soy sauce can balance it out.</li><li><strong>Garnish</strong>: Garnish with freshly chopped green onions to add a pop of color and a hint of freshness to the dish.</li></ol><h2 id=serving-galbi-jjim>Serving Galbi Jjim</h2><p>Galbi Jjim is best served hot and fresh from the pot. It’s traditionally enjoyed with steamed white rice and an array of Korean banchan (side dishes) such as kimchi, pickled vegetables, and steamed vegetables. The rich, savory sauce of the short ribs pairs perfectly with the neutral flavor of the rice, creating a balanced meal.</p><h3 id=tips-for-perfect-galbi-jjim>Tips for Perfect Galbi Jjim</h3><ul><li><strong>Choosing the right short ribs</strong>: Look for meaty short ribs with plenty of marbling. The fat will render during the braising process, making the meat more tender and flavorful.</li><li><strong>Braising time</strong>: The longer you braise the short ribs, the more tender the meat will be. While 2-3 hours is usually sufficient, don’t hesitate to cook them longer if you prefer extremely tender, falling-apart meat.</li><li><strong>Adjusting sweetness</strong>: Galbi Jjim is traditionally sweet, but if you prefer a more savory version, you can reduce the sugar or honey in the marinade.</li></ul><h2 id=variations-of-galbi-jjim>Variations of Galbi Jjim</h2><p>Galbi Jjim is incredibly versatile, and there are a few variations you can experiment with to personalize the dish.</p><h3 id=spicy-galbi-jjim>Spicy Galbi Jjim</h3><p>For those who enjoy a bit of heat, adding <strong>gochujang</strong> (Korean red chili paste) or <strong>gochugaru</strong> (Korean chili flakes) to the marinade or braising liquid will give the dish a spicy kick. Adjust the amount based on your personal spice tolerance.</p><h3 id=vegetarian-galbi-jjim>Vegetarian Galbi Jjim</h3><p>While traditionally made with beef short ribs, you can create a vegetarian version using <strong>tofu</strong> or <strong>seitan</strong> as the main protein. The braising liquid will still work beautifully with these alternatives, giving you a hearty and flavorful dish.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Korean Braised Short Ribs (Galbi Jjim) is a dish that is sure to become a favorite in your cooking repertoire. The combination of tender short ribs, a rich, savory-sweet sauce, and the comfort of a home-cooked meal make this dish an unforgettable experience. Whether you’re cooking for a special occasion or simply want to indulge in something delicious, Galbi Jjim is a meal that will impress and satisfy.
