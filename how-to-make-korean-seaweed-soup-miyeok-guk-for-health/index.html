It has been an essential part of Korean cuisine for centuries and is often served on birthdays, as well as for post-natal recovery. The dish is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients that can support your overall well-being. This soup is made with miyeok, or dried seaweed, and a flavorful broth, typically using beef or anchovy stock.</p><p>In this post, we&rsquo;ll walk you through how to make this nutrient-dense soup, discuss its health benefits, and explore why this dish should be a staple in your diet.</p><h2 id=what-is-miyeok-guk>What is Miyeok Guk?</h2><p>Miyeok Guk is a savory and comforting soup made with miyeok, a type of edible seaweed known as wakame in Japanese. It has a slightly slimy texture when cooked and absorbs the rich flavors of the broth. This soup is a vital part of Korean culture, as it&rsquo;s traditionally eaten by new mothers after childbirth to help replenish vital nutrients lost during delivery.</p><p>Miyeok, or seaweed, is a superfood packed with essential vitamins and minerals, including iodine, calcium, magnesium, and iron. It is low in calories but high in fiber, making it a great food for digestion and overall health.</p><p>While the traditional preparation of Miyeok Guk often involves beef broth, you can also find variations made with fish or vegetarian broths. The soup is usually served with steamed rice and kimchi, making it a comforting meal on a cold day.</p><h2 id=health-benefits-of-miyeok-guk>Health Benefits of Miyeok Guk</h2><h3 id=1-rich-in-nutrients>1. <strong>Rich in Nutrients</strong></h3><p>Miyeok is highly nutritious and contains a wide range of vitamins and minerals essential for maintaining good health. It is an excellent source of iodine, which supports thyroid health and helps maintain hormonal balance. Seaweed is also rich in calcium, magnesium, and potassium, promoting strong bones and healthy muscles.</p><h3 id=2-supports-digestion>2. <strong>Supports Digestion</strong></h3><p>Miyeok Guk is rich in soluble fiber, which helps with digestion and promotes gut health. The seaweed in the soup acts as a prebiotic, feeding the beneficial bacteria in the gut, which is vital for a healthy digestive system. Regular consumption of this soup can help alleviate constipation and support overall digestion.</p><h3 id=3-boosts-immune-function>3. <strong>Boosts Immune Function</strong></h3><p>The vitamins and minerals found in miyeok, especially vitamin C and antioxidants, can help boost the immune system. Seaweed contains compounds that may have anti-inflammatory properties, which can protect the body from infections and illnesses.</p><h3 id=4-promotes-healthy-skin>4. <strong>Promotes Healthy Skin</strong></h3><p>Due to its high content of omega-3 fatty acids, miyeok Guk is great for promoting healthy skin. Omega-3s help maintain the skin&rsquo;s natural barrier, preventing dryness and improving its overall appearance. Additionally, the antioxidants in seaweed protect the skin from environmental damage.</p><h3 id=5-aids-postpartum-recovery>5. <strong>Aids Postpartum Recovery</strong></h3><p>In Korea, miyeok guk is famously consumed by women who have just given birth. The soup is believed to help replenish essential nutrients that are lost during childbirth and breastfeeding. The calcium and iron found in seaweed can support bone health and help recover from the physical stresses of delivery.</p><h3 id=6-supports-weight-loss>6. <strong>Supports Weight Loss</strong></h3><p>Miyeok Guk is low in calories and high in fiber, making it an excellent option for anyone looking to maintain a healthy weight or even lose a few pounds. The fiber in seaweed can help you feel full for longer, preventing overeating and promoting weight loss.</p><h2 id=how-to-make-korean-seaweed-soup-miyeok-guk>How to Make Korean Seaweed Soup (Miyeok Guk)</h2><p>Now that we&rsquo;ve discussed the benefits of this incredible soup, let&rsquo;s dive into the step-by-step process of making Miyeok Guk. Whether you&rsquo;re making it for the first time or you&rsquo;re a seasoned cook, this recipe will guide you through the entire process.</p><h3 id=ingredients>Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>1 cup dried miyeok (Korean seaweed)</li><li>6 cups beef broth or vegetable broth (you can also use anchovy stock)</li><li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li><li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li><li>1-2 garlic cloves (minced)</li><li>1/2 pound beef (or chicken) brisket (optional for meat-based version)</li><li>Salt to taste</li><li>Freshly ground black pepper to taste</li><li>Cooked rice for serving</li></ul><h3 id=instructions>Instructions:</h3><h4 id=step-1-soak-the-seaweed>Step 1: Soak the Seaweed</h4><p>The first step in making Miyeok Guk is to soak the dried miyeok. Place the dried seaweed in a large bowl and cover it with cold water. Let it soak for about 20-30 minutes to allow the seaweed to rehydrate and expand. Once the seaweed is fully rehydrated, drain the water and rinse the seaweed under cold water to remove any residual salt.</p><h4 id=step-2-prepare-the-broth>Step 2: Prepare the Broth</h4><p>If you&rsquo;re using beef, you can start by cutting the beef into thin slices or small chunks. Heat a large pot over medium heat and add the sesame oil. Once the oil is hot, add the sliced beef and cook until browned on all sides. You can skip this step if you prefer a vegetarian version and proceed with the vegetable broth.</p><p>Add minced garlic to the pot and saut√© for a minute until fragrant. This adds a delicious, aromatic base to your broth. Next, add the beef (or vegetable) broth to the pot. Bring it to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer.</p><h4 id=step-3-add-the-seaweed>Step 3: Add the Seaweed</h4><p>Once the broth is simmering, add the soaked and drained seaweed to the pot. Stir the seaweed into the broth to ensure that it is evenly distributed. Continue to cook for an additional 10-15 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together and the seaweed to soften further.</p><h4 id=step-4-season-the-soup>Step 4: Season the Soup</h4><p>After the seaweed has cooked through, it&rsquo;s time to season the soup. Add soy sauce to taste and stir to combine. If you&rsquo;d like a slightly deeper flavor, you can also add a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning as necessary.</p><h4 id=step-5-simmer-and-serve>Step 5: Simmer and Serve</h4><p>Let the soup simmer for another 5-10 minutes, allowing the flavors to deepen. Once the soup is ready, remove it from the heat and serve it hot with a bowl of steamed rice on the side. Miyeok Guk is traditionally enjoyed with a bowl of kimchi, which adds a perfect tangy contrast to the savory flavors of the soup.</p><h3 id=tips-for-the-best-miyeok-guk>Tips for the Best Miyeok Guk</h3><ul><li><strong>Use a good quality broth</strong>: Whether you use beef, chicken, or vegetable broth, using a homemade or high-quality store-bought broth will make a big difference in the taste of your Miyeok Guk. If you&rsquo;re using beef, cooking the broth with beef brisket will impart a rich, savory flavor to the soup.</li><li><strong>Adjust the seasoning</strong>: The amount of soy sauce can be adjusted based on your taste preference. For a milder version, use less soy sauce, and for a stronger umami flavor, you can add more.</li><li><strong>Add other ingredients</strong>: While the traditional Miyeok Guk recipe is simple, you can get creative by adding other ingredients. For example, you can add tofu for extra protein or incorporate a variety of vegetables for added nutrition and flavor.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-make-vegetarian-miyeok-guk>How to Make Vegetarian Miyeok Guk</h2><p>If you prefer a vegetarian or vegan version of Miyeok Guk, you can easily substitute the beef or chicken broth with a vegetable broth. You can also skip the meat entirely and focus on the rich seaweed flavor. Add tofu for protein and consider using mushrooms or other vegetables like carrots or zucchini for a more filling dish.</p><h3 id=ingredient-adjustments>Ingredient Adjustments:</h3><ul><li><strong>Broth</strong>: Use a vegetable broth or make a simple broth by boiling kombu (a type of kelp) and dried shiitake mushrooms.</li><li><strong>Protein</strong>: For a plant-based protein option, add firm tofu cut into cubes or tempeh for a hearty texture.</li></ul><h3 id=nutritional-information-for-miyeok-guk>Nutritional Information for Miyeok Guk</h3><p>Miyeok Guk is incredibly nutrient-dense and low in calories, making it an excellent option for those looking to maintain or lose weight while still enjoying a flavorful meal. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the nutritional content per serving (based on 1 cup of soup):</p><ul><li><strong>Calories</strong>: 80-100 kcal (depending on the type of broth and added ingredients)</li><li><strong>Protein</strong>: 7-10 grams (from meat or tofu)</li><li><strong>Fat</strong>: 3-5 grams (from sesame oil)</li><li><strong>Carbohydrates</strong>: 7-10 grams (mainly from seaweed)</li><li><strong>Fiber</strong>: 2-3 grams</li></ul><p>Miyeok Guk is a great option for people on a low-calorie or high-fiber diet.
