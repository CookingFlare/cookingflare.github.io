Their smoky, tender texture and bold flavors are a favorite among many. However, making ribs traditionally can take hours, which might discourage you from making them at home. But what if we told you that you can achieve the same mouthwatering results in under an hour using an Instant Pot? Yes, you read that correctly—tender, fall-off-the-bone ribs in less than 60 minutes.</p><p>In this post, we&rsquo;ll guide you step-by-step on how to make incredibly tender Instant Pot ribs that are bursting with flavor and texture, all without spending hours in the kitchen. Whether you&rsquo;re a busy home cook or just craving some delicious ribs, this recipe is for you!</p><h2 id=why-choose-the-instant-pot-for-ribs>Why Choose the Instant Pot for Ribs?</h2><p>Before diving into the recipe, let’s first explore why the Instant Pot is an excellent tool for cooking ribs. Traditionally, ribs are slow-cooked or smoked for hours, allowing the meat to become incredibly tender and juicy. While these methods produce fantastic results, they can be time-consuming.</p><p>The Instant Pot, however, is a game-changer. By using high pressure and steam, it mimics the effects of slow cooking in a fraction of the time. In fact, you can achieve perfectly tender ribs in just 25 minutes of cooking time, with a quick pressure release for even more convenience. Plus, the Instant Pot locks in moisture, ensuring that your ribs stay juicy and flavorful.</p><h2 id=what-youll-need>What You&rsquo;ll Need</h2><h3 id=ingredients>Ingredients:</h3><ul><li><strong>1 rack of baby back ribs</strong> (or spare ribs, if preferred)</li><li><strong>2 tablespoons of olive oil</strong></li><li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong> to taste</li><li><strong>1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar</strong></li><li><strong>1 cup of beef or chicken broth</strong></li><li><strong>1/4 cup of water</strong></li><li><strong>BBQ sauce</strong> (store-bought or homemade)</li><li><strong>Optional:</strong> Dry rub seasoning of your choice (paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, brown sugar, chili powder, etc.)</li></ul><h3 id=tools>Tools:</h3><ul><li><strong>Instant Pot</strong></li><li><strong>Tongs</strong></li><li><strong>Baking sheet or foil-lined tray</strong> (if finishing ribs in the oven)</li><li><strong>Sharp knife</strong> (for trimming ribs, if needed)</li></ul><h3 id=tips-before-you-begin>Tips Before You Begin:</h3><ul><li>Ensure your ribs fit inside the Instant Pot before starting. If necessary, cut the rack in half to make it fit.</li><li>If you prefer crispy, caramelized edges on your ribs, you’ll want to finish them under the broiler for a few minutes after pressure cooking.</li><li>Experiment with different seasonings for the dry rub to make the flavor profile your own. A blend of sweet, savory, and smoky flavors works exceptionally well.</li></ul><h2 id=step-by-step-guide-to-making-tender-instant-pot-ribs>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Tender Instant Pot Ribs</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-ribs>Step 1: Prepare the Ribs</h3><p>Start by preparing your rack of ribs. If your ribs still have the membrane on the back, remove it to ensure a more tender result. To do this, use a knife to gently loosen the membrane and peel it off with your hands or a paper towel.</p><p>Next, trim any excess fat, leaving just a thin layer on the ribs. This will help ensure that the ribs don’t become greasy during cooking.</p><h3 id=step-2-season-the-ribs>Step 2: Season the Ribs</h3><p>Rub the ribs generously with salt and pepper, making sure to cover both sides. If you’re using a dry rub, now is the time to apply it. Coat the ribs evenly with the seasoning mix, ensuring every inch of the meat is covered with flavor. Let the ribs sit for a few minutes to allow the seasoning to adhere.</p><h3 id=step-3-sear-the-ribs-optional-but-recommended>Step 3: Sear the Ribs (Optional, but Recommended)</h3><p>For added flavor, you can sear the ribs in the Instant Pot before pressure cooking. Turn your Instant Pot to the “Sauté” mode and add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Once the oil is hot, place the ribs in the pot, meaty side down, and sear for about 2-3 minutes until they develop a golden-brown crust. Flip the ribs over and sear the other side for another 2-3 minutes. This step adds depth to the flavor but can be skipped if you&rsquo;re short on time.</p><h3 id=step-4-prepare-the-instant-pot>Step 4: Prepare the Instant Pot</h3><p>Remove the ribs from the pot and set them aside. Add 1/4 cup of apple cider vinegar and 1 cup of beef or chicken broth to the Instant Pot. The vinegar helps tenderize the meat while adding a tangy kick to the overall flavor profile. Scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits from the searing process.</p><p>Next, add 1/4 cup of water to the Instant Pot to ensure there’s enough liquid for pressure cooking. This is essential to prevent the “Burn” notice on your Instant Pot.</p><h3 id=step-5-pressure-cook-the-ribs>Step 5: Pressure Cook the Ribs</h3><p>Place the trivet in the Instant Pot and arrange the ribs on top. Depending on the size of your Instant Pot, you may need to cut the ribs in half to fit them inside. Stack them upright if necessary, ensuring they are evenly distributed within the pot.</p><p>Lock the lid and ensure the vent is set to “Sealing.” Set the Instant Pot to cook on high pressure for 25 minutes. Once the cooking time is complete, allow for a quick release of pressure. This means you don’t need to wait for the pot to naturally release the pressure, making it a faster option.</p><h3 id=step-6-glaze-the-ribs>Step 6: Glaze the Ribs</h3><p>Once the ribs are finished pressure cooking, carefully remove them from the Instant Pot using tongs. Brush your favorite BBQ sauce generously over the ribs on both sides. If you prefer a slightly charred crust, you can take it a step further by broiling the ribs in the oven.</p><h3 id=step-7-broil-for-extra-flavor-optional>Step 7: Broil for Extra Flavor (Optional)</h3><p>Preheat your oven’s broiler. Line a baking sheet with foil to catch any drips, and place the ribs on the sheet. Broil the ribs for 4-5 minutes, watching them carefully to avoid burning the sauce. This step will give the ribs a delicious caramelized finish with a slight crispiness.</p><h3 id=step-8-serve-and-enjoy>Step 8: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>After broiling, remove the ribs from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes before slicing. Use a sharp knife to cut between the bones and serve the ribs with extra BBQ sauce on the side. Pair them with your favorite sides like coleslaw, baked beans, or cornbread for the ultimate meal.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-instant-pot-ribs-every-time>Tips for Perfect Instant Pot Ribs Every Time</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Cutting Ribs in Half</strong>: If you have a large rack of ribs, you may need to cut them in half to fit properly in the Instant Pot. This won’t affect the cooking process and helps ensure everything cooks evenly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flavor Variations</strong>: Feel free to experiment with different BBQ sauces, dry rubs, or marinades to create your own signature rib recipe. You can also use other liquids such as beer or apple juice for a unique flavor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resting Time</strong>: Allow the ribs to rest for 5-10 minutes before serving. This gives the juices time to redistribute, ensuring that each bite is tender and flavorful.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make Ahead</strong>: You can prepare the ribs ahead of time by seasoning them and refrigerating them until you’re ready to cook. This can save time on the day of the meal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Storing Leftovers</strong>: If you have any leftover ribs, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days. Reheat them in the oven or microwave before serving.</p></li></ul><h2 id=why-youll-love-instant-pot-ribs>Why You’ll Love Instant Pot Ribs</h2><p>The Instant Pot isn’t just a quick way to make ribs; it also enhances the overall flavor and texture of the meat.
