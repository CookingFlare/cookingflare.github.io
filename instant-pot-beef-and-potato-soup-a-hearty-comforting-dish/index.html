Luckily, beef and potato soup is made with simple, wholesome ingredients that you may already have in your kitchen. Here&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll need:</p><h3 id=for-the-soup-base>For the Soup Base:</h3><ul><li><strong>Beef stew meat (1.5 pounds)</strong> – Look for chuck roast or beef stew meat. The marbling in this cut will ensure the beef becomes tender and flavorful as it cooks.</li><li><strong>Potatoes (4 large)</strong> – Yukon Gold or Russet potatoes work best for this soup. Yukon Gold potatoes offer a creamy texture, while Russet potatoes break down a little more and thicken the soup.</li><li><strong>Onion (1 medium)</strong> – A finely chopped onion brings flavor to the base of the soup.</li><li><strong>Garlic (4 cloves)</strong> – Fresh garlic adds depth and aroma to the dish.</li><li><strong>Carrots (2 medium)</strong> – These provide natural sweetness and additional texture.</li><li><strong>Celery (2 stalks)</strong> – Celery brings a subtle crunch and flavor balance to the soup.</li><li><strong>Beef broth (4 cups)</strong> – For a rich and savory broth, beef broth is the best option. You can also use a low-sodium variety if preferred.</li><li><strong>Water (1 cup)</strong> – To adjust the consistency of the soup.</li><li><strong>Tomato paste (2 tablespoons)</strong> – Adds depth and a hint of sweetness to the broth.</li><li><strong>Bay leaves (2)</strong> – A key herb for seasoning the soup.</li><li><strong>Thyme (1 teaspoon)</strong> – Fresh thyme or dried thyme is perfect for this dish.</li><li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong> – Essential seasonings to taste.</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-creamy-finish>For the Creamy Finish:</h3><ul><li><strong>Heavy cream (1/2 cup)</strong> – Adds richness and creaminess to the soup.</li><li><strong>Cheddar cheese (1/2 cup, shredded)</strong> – Optional, but adding shredded cheese right before serving will give the soup an extra layer of flavor.</li><li><strong>Parsley (optional, for garnish)</strong> – Fresh parsley adds a touch of color and brightness to the final dish.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-make-instant-pot-beef-and-potato-soup>How to Make Instant Pot Beef and Potato Soup</h2><p>Now that you have your ingredients, let’s dive into the step-by-step process of preparing this easy and flavorful beef and potato soup. Whether you’re cooking for a crowd or just your family, this recipe is sure to please.</p><h3 id=step-1-sauté-the-beef-and-vegetables>Step 1: Sauté the Beef and Vegetables</h3><p>Start by setting your Instant Pot to the “Sauté” mode. Once it&rsquo;s hot, add a tablespoon of olive oil or vegetable oil. Brown the beef stew meat in batches so it doesn&rsquo;t crowd the pot. This step is essential for developing deep, rich flavors. After the beef is browned on all sides, remove it from the pot and set it aside.</p><p>In the same pot, add the chopped onion, carrots, celery, and garlic. Sauté for about 3-4 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften and the onions are translucent. This step helps to release the natural sweetness of the vegetables and create a flavor base for the soup.</p><h3 id=step-2-deglaze-the-pot>Step 2: Deglaze the Pot</h3><p>Once the vegetables have softened, it’s time to deglaze the pot. This means you need to loosen up any flavorful brown bits that have stuck to the bottom of the pot from browning the beef and vegetables. Pour in a splash of beef broth and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any stuck-on bits. This is where a lot of the flavor comes from, so don’t skip this step!</p><h3 id=step-3-add-remaining-ingredients>Step 3: Add Remaining Ingredients</h3><p>Now, return the browned beef to the pot along with the remaining beef broth, water, tomato paste, bay leaves, thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir everything together, making sure the beef is submerged in the liquid. Add the chopped potatoes and give it one final stir.</p><h3 id=step-4-pressure-cook>Step 4: Pressure Cook</h3><p>Secure the Instant Pot lid and set the valve to the “Sealing” position. Choose the “Pressure Cook” or “Manual” setting and cook on high pressure for 20 minutes. This will give the beef plenty of time to tenderize and the potatoes to soften without becoming mushy.</p><h3 id=step-5-quick-release-and-finish-the-soup>Step 5: Quick Release and Finish the Soup</h3><p>Once the cooking time is up, perform a quick release by carefully turning the valve to “Venting” to release the pressure. Once the pressure has been released, open the Instant Pot. You’ll be greeted with a deliciously fragrant, savory soup.</p><p>Now, remove the bay leaves and discard them. Stir in the heavy cream, which will give the soup a creamy, velvety texture. If you like your soup even creamier, feel free to add more cream to taste. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper if necessary.</p><h3 id=step-6-serve-and-enjoy>Step 6: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Ladle the soup into bowls and top with shredded cheddar cheese if desired. A sprinkle of fresh parsley will add a burst of color and a touch of freshness to the dish.</p><p>Serve the soup hot with a slice of crusty bread or crackers on the side for dipping. This Instant Pot beef and potato soup is perfect for cozy family dinners, and it also makes for great leftovers.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-instant-pot-beef-and-potato-soup>Tips for Perfect Instant Pot Beef and Potato Soup</h2><p>While this recipe is straightforward, here are a few tips to ensure your soup turns out perfect every time:</p><h3 id=1-use-the-right-cut-of-beef>1. <strong>Use the Right Cut of Beef</strong></h3><p>For the best flavor and tenderness, it’s important to use a good cut of beef. Chuck roast or stew meat are ideal because they have enough fat and marbling to become tender after pressure cooking. Avoid lean cuts like sirloin, as they may turn out tough.</p><h3 id=2-cut-the-potatoes-evenly>2. <strong>Cut the Potatoes Evenly</strong></h3><p>To ensure even cooking, make sure to cut your potatoes into uniform cubes. This will help them cook evenly and prevent some pieces from turning mushy while others remain undercooked.</p><h3 id=3-adjust-the-consistency>3. <strong>Adjust the Consistency</strong></h3><p>If you prefer a thicker soup, you can mash some of the potatoes in the pot with a potato masher or immersion blender after cooking. This will help thicken the soup naturally without needing to add any flour or cornstarch.</p><h3 id=4-add-more-vegetables>4. <strong>Add More Vegetables</strong></h3><p>Feel free to get creative with your vegetables. You can add parsnips, leeks, or even corn for added texture and flavor. Just make sure that the vegetables are cut to a similar size so they cook evenly.</p><h3 id=5-make-it-spicy>5. <strong>Make It Spicy</strong></h3><p>If you like a bit of heat, consider adding a pinch of red pepper flakes or a diced jalapeño to the pot with the vegetables for some extra spice.</p><h2 id=why-this-recipe-is-a-winner>Why This Recipe is a Winner</h2><p>Instant Pot beef and potato soup is a dish that combines ease and flavor in the best possible way.
