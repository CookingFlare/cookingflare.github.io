Make sure to use fresh raspberries, as their vibrant color and sweet-tart flavor will make a significant difference in the final product.</p><h3 id=for-the-cake>For the Cake:</h3><ul><li>1 cup all-purpose flour (or gluten-free flour for a gluten-free version)</li><li>1/2 cup almond meal (or ground almonds)</li><li>1/2 cup granulated sugar or coconut sugar</li><li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li><li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li><li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li><li>1/2 teaspoon almond extract</li><li>1/4 cup vegetable oil or melted coconut oil</li><li>1 cup unsweetened almond milk (or any plant-based milk of your choice)</li><li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (helps to activate the baking soda for a lighter texture)</li><li>1 cup fresh raspberries (frozen raspberries also work)</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-almond-streusel-topping>For the Almond Streusel Topping:</h3><ul><li>1/4 cup almond meal (or ground almonds)</li><li>2 tablespoons almond butter (or any nut butter of your choice)</li><li>2 tablespoons maple syrup or agave nectar</li><li>1/4 cup chopped almonds (for added crunch)</li></ul><h2 id=instructions-how-to-make-vegan-raspberry-almond-cake>Instructions: How to Make Vegan Raspberry Almond Cake</h2><h3 id=step-1-preheat-the-oven-and-prepare-the-pan>Step 1: Preheat the Oven and Prepare the Pan</h3><p>Start by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). While the oven heats up, grease a round 8-inch cake pan with a little bit of oil or line it with parchment paper. This ensures that the cake comes out easily once it’s done baking.</p><h3 id=step-2-prepare-the-dry-ingredients>Step 2: Prepare the Dry Ingredients</h3><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, almond meal, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Stir everything together so that the dry ingredients are evenly mixed. The almond meal adds a lovely nutty flavor and makes the cake extra moist, while the baking powder and soda will help the cake rise.</p><h3 id=step-3-mix-the-wet-ingredients>Step 3: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h3><p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond milk, vegetable oil (or melted coconut oil), apple cider vinegar, and almond extract. The combination of these wet ingredients will help give the cake its soft and fluffy texture, while the almond extract enhances the cake’s nutty flavor.</p><h3 id=step-4-combine-wet-and-dry-ingredients>Step 4: Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients</h3><p>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, and gently mix until everything is combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cake. You want a smooth batter with a few lumps.</p><h3 id=step-5-fold-in-the-fresh-raspberries>Step 5: Fold in the Fresh Raspberries</h3><p>Once your batter is smooth, gently fold in the fresh raspberries. It’s important to do this step gently so that the raspberries don’t break up too much and release too much juice. You want to keep them intact for that beautiful burst of fruity flavor in every bite.</p><h3 id=step-6-prepare-the-almond-streusel-topping>Step 6: Prepare the Almond Streusel Topping</h3><p>In a small bowl, mix together the almond meal, almond butter, maple syrup, and chopped almonds. Stir until it forms a crumbly texture. This will be your streusel topping, which adds a delightful crunch to the cake. The almond butter helps bind the ingredients together while adding a rich, nutty flavor.</p><h3 id=step-7-assemble-the-cake>Step 7: Assemble the Cake</h3><p>Pour the cake batter into the prepared cake pan, spreading it evenly. Sprinkle the almond streusel topping over the batter, making sure to cover the surface evenly. The streusel will bake into a golden, crunchy topping that contrasts beautifully with the soft, moist cake beneath it.</p><h3 id=step-8-bake-the-cake>Step 8: Bake the Cake</h3><p>Place the cake in the preheated oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (or with just a few crumbs). The top of the cake should be golden brown, and the smell will be irresistible.</p><h3 id=step-9-let-the-cake-cool>Step 9: Let the Cake Cool</h3><p>Once the cake is done, remove it from the oven and allow it to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. After that, transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. This helps prevent the cake from becoming soggy and ensures that it sets properly.</p><h3 id=step-10-serve-and-enjoy>Step 10: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Once the cake has cooled, it’s ready to be sliced and served. You can serve it as-is, or add a dusting of powdered sugar for a little extra sweetness. For an added treat, serve with a dollop of vegan whipped cream or a scoop of dairy-free vanilla ice cream.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-best-vegan-raspberry-almond-cake>Tips for the Best Vegan Raspberry Almond Cake</h2><ul><li><strong>Choose Fresh Raspberries</strong>: Fresh raspberries will give you the best flavor and texture in this cake. If fresh raspberries are not available, frozen raspberries work just as well. However, be sure to thaw and drain them before adding them to the batter to prevent excess moisture.</li><li><strong>Use Almond Meal or Ground Almonds</strong>: Almond meal provides a wonderful nutty flavor and helps keep the cake moist. Ground almonds are a great alternative if you don’t have almond meal on hand.</li><li><strong>Customize the Streusel</strong>: Feel free to experiment with the streusel topping. You can add a touch of cinnamon or nutmeg for extra warmth or switch up the nuts based on what you have on hand. Walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts would all be delicious options.</li><li><strong>Make It Gluten-Free</strong>: To make this cake gluten-free, simply swap the all-purpose flour with a gluten-free flour blend. Make sure your almond meal is certified gluten-free as well.</li><li><strong>Sweeten to Taste</strong>: The amount of sugar you use can be adjusted based on your personal preference. If you prefer a less sweet cake, you can reduce the sugar slightly. Alternatively, you can substitute maple syrup, agave nectar, or coconut sugar for a more natural sweetness.</li></ul><h2 id=health-benefits-of-vegan-raspberry-almond-cake>Health Benefits of Vegan Raspberry Almond Cake</h2><p>While this cake is indulgent, it also contains plenty of nutritious ingredients. Let’s take a look at some of the health benefits of the key ingredients:</p><ul><li><strong>Raspberries</strong>: Raspberries are packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and fiber. They’re a great source of vitamin C, which boosts the immune system and promotes skin health. They also contain plenty of fiber, which supports digestion and helps keep you feeling full longer.</li><li><strong>Almonds</strong>: Almonds are a great source of healthy fats, protein, and fiber. They can help lower bad cholesterol levels, improve heart health, and provide sustained energy throughout the day. Almonds also contain magnesium, which supports bone health and muscle function.</li><li><strong>Plant-Based Ingredients</strong>: By using plant-based ingredients, this cake is naturally dairy-free, egg-free, and suitable for those with lactose intolerance. It’s a great option for vegans, vegetarians, and anyone looking to reduce their intake of animal products.</li></ul><h2 id=variations-to-try>Variations to Try</h2><p>While this raspberry almond cake is delicious on its own, there are several ways to customize it to your tastes.

The bright lemon flavor will pair perfectly with the tangy raspberries and enhance the overall taste.</p><h3 id=chocolate-raspberry-almond-cake>Chocolate Raspberry Almond Cake</h3><p>If you’re a fan of chocolate, consider adding 1/2 cup of dairy-free chocolate chips to the batter.
