Known for its rich flavors and comforting warmth, this stew is made with soft, silky tofu, a variety of vegetables, and often a choice of protein. Its versatility and ease of preparation make it a perfect dish for almost any occasion, whether you’re looking for a hearty weeknight meal or something to impress guests at a dinner party.</p><p>In this guide, we&rsquo;ll walk you through the steps to create an authentic and delicious Korean Tofu Stew, as well as explore the essential ingredients, tips, and variations. Whether you’re a beginner in the kitchen or an experienced cook, you&rsquo;ll find this recipe simple to follow and packed with flavor.</p><h2 id=what-is-sundubu-jjigae>What is Sundubu Jjigae?</h2><p>Sundubu Jjigae is a Korean dish made primarily with uncurdled soft tofu, known as &ldquo;sundubu.&rdquo; Unlike regular tofu, which is firm and cut into blocks, sundubu is a smooth and delicate tofu that has a high water content. The stew is traditionally prepared with a savory broth made from anchovies or seafood, seasoned with gochujang (Korean chili paste) or gochugaru (chili flakes), and filled with vegetables, meat, or seafood.</p><p>The dish is typically served bubbling hot in a stone pot, with a raw egg added just before serving to create a rich, velvety texture. The combination of spicy, savory, and slightly tangy flavors makes Sundubu Jjigae a satisfying meal that perfectly balances heat and depth.</p><h2 id=key-ingredients-for-korean-tofu-stew>Key Ingredients for Korean Tofu Stew</h2><p>To make an authentic Sundubu Jjigae, you’ll need a few essential ingredients. While the recipe can vary slightly depending on personal preferences or regional differences, the following ingredients are key to achieving that authentic taste.</p><h3 id=1-sundubu-soft-tofu>1. <strong>Sundubu (Soft Tofu)</strong></h3><p>The star of this dish is the tofu itself. Sundubu is a soft, creamy tofu that has not been pressed, which gives it a delicate and silky texture. It’s often found in Korean grocery stores, but if you can’t find it, silken tofu can be used as an alternative. However, sundubu is preferred for its smooth consistency and unique mouthfeel.</p><h3 id=2-gochujang-korean-chili-paste>2. <strong>Gochujang (Korean Chili Paste)</strong></h3><p>This fermented chili paste is essential for giving the stew its signature depth of flavor and heat. Gochujang is made from chili peppers, fermented soybeans, and rice, giving it a sweet, salty, and spicy taste. A tablespoon or two of gochujang can really elevate the stew, but you can adjust the amount based on your preferred spice level.</p><h3 id=3-gochugaru-korean-chili-flakes>3. <strong>Gochugaru (Korean Chili Flakes)</strong></h3><p>Gochugaru is another key ingredient in Korean cuisine. These chili flakes provide heat as well as a mild smokiness. They’re often used in combination with gochujang to balance the stew’s spiciness and add more complexity to the dish.</p><h3 id=4-garlic-and-onion>4. <strong>Garlic and Onion</strong></h3><p>Garlic and onion are aromatic essentials in Korean cooking. They form the base of the stew’s flavor profile, adding sweetness, savory notes, and a pleasant fragrance. Fresh garlic and onions should be used, finely chopped for easy cooking.</p><h3 id=5-kimchi-optional>5. <strong>Kimchi (Optional)</strong></h3><p>For a more complex and slightly tangy flavor, you can add some chopped kimchi. This fermented cabbage dish adds an extra layer of richness and depth to the stew, though it’s entirely optional.</p><h3 id=6-vegetables>6. <strong>Vegetables</strong></h3><p>Common vegetables used in Sundubu Jjigae include mushrooms (shiitake or oyster mushrooms work well), zucchini, and green onions. These vegetables add flavor, texture, and color to the stew, creating a beautiful contrast against the creamy tofu.</p><h3 id=7-protein-optional>7. <strong>Protein (Optional)</strong></h3><p>Sundubu Jjigae can be made with various proteins such as beef, pork, seafood, or even vegetarian options like mushrooms or tofu. Pork and seafood are the most common choices, with seafood varieties including clams, shrimp, or even squid.</p><h3 id=8-seasonings>8. <strong>Seasonings</strong></h3><p>To season the stew, you&rsquo;ll need soy sauce for umami, sesame oil for depth and richness, and a dash of salt to balance the flavors. You can also use anchovy stock or vegetable broth as the base of the stew for added richness.</p><h3 id=9-egg-optional>9. <strong>Egg (Optional)</strong></h3><p>A raw egg is often cracked into the stew just before serving, giving it a silky texture and richness. The egg gently cooks in the hot broth, adding an extra layer of flavor and texture.</p><h2 id=step-by-step-guide-to-making-sundubu-jjigae>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Sundubu Jjigae</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-ingredients>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3><p>Start by gathering all of your ingredients. If you&rsquo;re using protein, such as pork or seafood, make sure it&rsquo;s sliced or chopped into bite-sized pieces. Clean and slice your mushrooms, chop the onions, garlic, and zucchini, and slice your green onions. If you&rsquo;re adding kimchi, chop it into small pieces.</p><h3 id=step-2-sauté-the-aromatics>Step 2: Sauté the Aromatics</h3><p>In a large pot, heat a tablespoon of sesame oil over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped onions and garlic. Sauté for about 2-3 minutes, until the onions become translucent and the garlic is fragrant.</p><h3 id=step-3-add-the-protein-optional>Step 3: Add the Protein (Optional)</h3><p>If you&rsquo;re using pork or beef, add the meat to the pot and cook until it browns. If you’re using seafood like shrimp, squid, or clams, add them later, as they cook faster. Stir the meat or seafood into the aromatic mixture, ensuring it gets coated in the oil and flavors.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-the-vegetables-and-gochujang>Step 4: Add the Vegetables and Gochujang</h3><p>Next, add the sliced zucchini, mushrooms, and kimchi (if using). Stir everything together for a minute, allowing the vegetables to soften slightly. Then, add a tablespoon or two of gochujang and gochugaru to the pot. Stir well to coat the ingredients in the chili paste and flakes, which will help bring out the stew&rsquo;s characteristic spicy flavor.</p><h3 id=step-5-add-the-broth>Step 5: Add the Broth</h3><p>Now it’s time to add the liquid that will form the base of the stew. If you have anchovy stock or dashi stock, pour it into the pot. If not, you can use water or vegetable broth. Add about 4 cups of liquid and bring it to a boil. Once the stew begins to boil, lower the heat and let it simmer for 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</p><h3 id=step-6-add-the-tofu>Step 6: Add the Tofu</h3><p>While the stew simmers, carefully add the sundubu (or silken tofu) to the pot. Use a spoon to gently break the tofu into large chunks. Sundubu tofu is soft and delicate, so you don’t want to stir it too vigorously. Let the tofu heat through in the broth for about 5 minutes. If you prefer a thicker stew, you can add a little more gochujang at this point.</p><h3 id=step-7-season-the-stew>Step 7: Season the Stew</h3><p>Taste the stew and adjust the seasoning as needed. You can add a splash of soy sauce for saltiness and depth, or a dash of salt if needed. If you want more heat, add extra gochugaru or gochujang. Add the green onions and stir gently.</p><h3 id=step-8-add-the-egg-optional>Step 8: Add the Egg (Optional)</h3><p>Just before serving, crack a raw egg into the stew, either right in the pot or in each individual serving bowl. Allow the egg to cook in the hot broth for about 1-2 minutes, or until the white is set, but the yolk remains runny. The egg will add a luxurious, creamy texture to the stew.</p><h3 id=step-9-serve-and-enjoy>Step 9: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Sundubu Jjigae is traditionally served in a hot stone pot, which keeps the stew bubbling and steaming until the very last bite. Serve the stew with steamed rice and a side of kimchi for a complete meal. The combination of hot, spicy broth and silky tofu is the perfect balance, and the egg adds a beautiful finishing touch.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-perfect-sundubu-jjigae>Tips for the Perfect Sundubu Jjigae</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Use a variety of mushrooms:</strong> Mushrooms like shiitake or oyster mushrooms add an earthy flavor that complements the soft tofu. Feel free to experiment with different varieties of mushrooms to enhance the stew’s taste.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adjust spice levels:</strong> Depending on your preference, you can control the heat of the dish by adjusting the amount of gochujang and gochugaru. Start with a small amount and taste as you go.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add more vegetables:</strong> Feel free to add other vegetables such as spinach, bok choy, or carrots to the stew. The more vegetables you include, the more nutrients your stew will have.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it vegan:</strong> To make Sundubu Jjigae vegan, simply skip the egg and use plant-based protein or extra vegetables instead of meat. Vegetable broth will work perfectly as the base.</p></li><li><p><strong>Serve it sizzling:</strong> If you want to recreate the traditional Korean experience, serve the stew in a hot stone pot. The heat helps maintain the temperature and adds to the presentation.</p></li></ul><h2 id=variations-of-sundubu-jjigae>Variations of Sundubu Jjigae</h2><p>While the basic Sundubu Jjigae is delicious on its own, you can get creative with different variations of this dish.</p><h3 id=seafood-sundubu-jjigae>Seafood Sundubu Jjigae</h3><p>For a more traditional twist, try adding a combination of seafood, such as clams, shrimp, and squid. The seafood infuses the broth with an extra layer of umami, making the stew even more flavorful.</p><h3 id=pork-sundubu-jjigae>Pork Sundubu Jjigae</h3><p>If you’re a fan of pork, you can substitute pork belly or pork shoulder for the protein. The richness of the pork adds depth to the stew, making it hearty and satisfying.</p><h3 id=vegetarian-sundubu-jjigae>Vegetarian Sundubu Jjigae</h3><p>For a lighter version, try using mushrooms and tofu as the main ingredients.
