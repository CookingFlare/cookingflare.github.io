While many might envision the classic Western potato salad—heavy on the mayonnaise and often featuring hard-boiled eggs—the Japanese version is a harmonious blend of savory and sweet, making it a truly unique culinary experience. In this blog post, we will take you through the steps to create your very own Japanese Potato Salad, along with tips and variations to make the dish your own.
Ingredients
To get started, let’s gather all the ingredients you’ll need for this delectable side dish:</p><p>500g Japanese potatoes (such as Katakuri or Satsuma-imo)
1/2 cup carrot, finely diced
1/2 cup cucumber, thinly sliced
1/2 cup cooked corn (canned or frozen)
1/4 cup red onion, finely chopped
1/2 cup Japanese mayonnaise (like Kewpie or another brand)
1 tablespoon rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)
1 tablespoon sugar
Salt and pepper, to taste
Optional: 1/4 cup ham or smoked salmon, diced; boiled eggs, chopped; or pickles for an extra tang.</p><p>Choosing the Right Potatoes
When it comes to making Japanese Potato Salad, the type of potato you use can make a significant difference in texture and taste. Japanese potatoes are starchier and creamier than the common Russet or Yukon Gold varieties. They also have a slightly sweet flavor, which complements the sweetness found in the other ingredients. Look for potatoes labeled as “Japanese potatoes” or any that are waxy and smooth, ensuring a velvety final product.
The Cooking Process
Step 1: Boil the Potatoes</p><p>Start by scrubbing your Japanese potatoes under cold water to remove any dirt. Once cleaned, place them in a large pot and cover them with cold water.
Add a pinch of salt to the water to flavor the potatoes as they cook. Bring the pot to a boil over high heat, then reduce to medium heat once boiling.
Cook the potatoes until they are fork-tender, typically around 15-20 minutes. Be careful not to overcook them, as they can become too soft.</p><p>Step 2: Prepare the Vegetables</p><p>While the potatoes are boiling, prepare your vegetables. Dice the carrots into small cubes, slice the cucumber thinly, and finely chop the red onion.
If you are using fresh corn, cook it in boiling water for a few minutes until tender, then cut it off the cob. If using frozen corn, you can simply thaw it.</p><p>Step 3: Cool the Potatoes
Once your potatoes are cooked, drain them in a colander and allow them to cool for a few minutes. When they are cool enough to handle, peel the skins off and cut the potatoes into bite-sized cubes.
Step 4: Mix the Dressing
In a separate bowl, whisk together the Japanese mayonnaise, rice vinegar, sugar, and a pinch of salt and pepper. This mixture is the heart of your salad, imbuing it with a tangy yet sweet flavor profile that makes this potato salad so special.
Step 5: Assemble the Salad</p><p>In a large mixing bowl, combine the cubed potatoes, carrots, cucumber, corn, and onion with the dressing. Gently fold everything together, being careful not to mash the potatoes.
Taste the salad and adjust the seasoning, adding more salt, pepper, or a touch of sugar if you’d like a sweeter profile.</p><p>Step 6: Chill Before Serving
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid, and allow the potato salad to chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to an hour. This chilling step allows the flavors to meld beautifully and creates a refreshing dish that is perfect for any occasion.
Serving Suggestions
Japanese Potato Salad can be served as a standalone dish, a side with grilled meats, or even as part of a bento box. Its creamy texture and subtle sweetness make it a great accompaniment to savory foods. Here are some ideas to showcase this delightful salad:</p><p>Serve alongside karaage (Japanese fried chicken) for a perfectly paired meal.
Scoop it onto a bed of leafy greens for a light lunch.
Use it as a filling for Japanese-style sandwiches (or sando) for a picnic treat.
Pair it with grilled fish or a hearty stew to complement the meal.</p><p>Variations and Add-ins
While the traditional Japanese Potato Salad is delicious on its own, don’t hesitate to add your personal touch. Here are some variations and add-ins you might consider:</p><p>Protein Power: Add diced ham, shredded chicken, or even crab meat for a more filling salad.
Creamy Extravagance: Try mixing in some cream cheese for a richer texture, or add a dollop of sour cream for an extra tang.
Sweet Surprise: For those who enjoy sweeter flavors, consider mixing in diced apples or grapes for a refreshing twist.
Seasonal Vegetables: Incorporate seasonal vegetables like peas, bell peppers, or even roasted mushrooms for added depth and flavor.
Herbal Notes: Chopped fresh parsley, scallions, or even shiso leaves can introduce refreshing herbal notes to your salad.</p><p>A Brief History of Japanese Potato Salad
Understanding the cultural significance of Japanese Potato Salad adds another layer of appreciation to this dish. The origins of potato salad in Japan date back to the late 19th century, coming from Western influences during the Meiji Restoration. Over time, it evolved, taking on characteristics unique to Japanese cuisine. The addition of mayonnaise, often with a distinct umami taste, transformed the dish into a beloved staple at home-cooked meals, picnics, and potlucks.
Japanese Potato Salad is often found in local izakayas (Japanese pubs) and is a common side dish at family gatherings and celebrations. Its accessibility and adaptability make it a favorite amongst Japanese households, where everyone finds joy in its comforting taste.
Nutritional Benefits of Potatoes
Potatoes, when prepared healthily, can be a nutritious addition to your diet. Rich in vitamins and minerals such as vitamin C, potassium, and B vitamins, they provide energy and support overall health. When combined with fresh vegetables, mayonnaise, and other nutritious toppings, Japanese Potato Salad can be a well-rounded addition to any meal.
Tips for Perfecting Your Potato Salad</p><p>Avoid Over-mixing: The goal is to keep the potatoes intact while ensuring everything is evenly coated in the dressing.
Use Quality Mayonnaise: Japanese mayonnaise is generally sweeter and creamier than its Western counterparts. Its unique flavor is a key component of the salad.
Adjust Flavor Preferences: Feel free to taste and tweak the dressing. You might prefer it creamier, tangier, or sweeter, so adjust based on your palate.
Chilling Time: Don’t rush this step! The flavor develops significantly when given time to meld in the refrigerator.</p><p>Conclusion

Whether you’re preparing it for a casual family dinner or a festive gathering, this dish is versatile and easily adapted to suit various tastes. With just a few basic ingredients, you can create a culinary masterpiece that boasts both savory and sweet notes—defining features of Japanese cuisine.
