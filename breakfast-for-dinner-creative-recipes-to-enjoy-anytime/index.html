But instead of serving them separately, why not combine them for the ultimate breakfast-for-dinner experience? The sweet and salty combination of pancakes and bacon is taken to the next level with a maple glaze.</p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong>:</p><ul><li>1 cup pancake mix (or homemade pancake batter)</li><li>4 strips of bacon</li><li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li><li>2 tablespoons butter</li><li>Fresh berries (optional)</li><li>Powdered sugar (optional)</li></ul><p><strong>Instructions</strong>:</p><ol><li>Cook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crispy.
