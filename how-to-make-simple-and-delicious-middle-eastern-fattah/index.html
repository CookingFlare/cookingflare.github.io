Add the chopped onions and sauté until they become translucent, which should take about 5 minutes. Then, add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute until fragrant.</p><p>Next, add the pieces of meat (lamb, beef, or chicken) to the pan. Cook the meat until browned on all sides. This should take around 8-10 minutes, depending on the size of the meat pieces.</p><p>Once the meat is browned, add the cumin, coriander, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Stir well to coat the meat evenly with the spices. These warm spices are essential to creating the signature flavor of Fattah.</p><p>Pour in the broth and bring the mixture to a simmer. Cover the pan and let it cook for about 30 minutes if you&rsquo;re using lamb or beef, or around 20 minutes for chicken. The meat should become tender, and the broth should reduce slightly. If needed, add a little more broth during cooking to ensure the meat stays moist.</p><h3 id=step-2-preparing-the-bread-layer>Step 2: Preparing the Bread Layer</h3><p>While the meat is cooking, it’s time to prepare the bread layer. Cut the pita bread or flatbreads into squares or strips, depending on your preference.</p><p>You can either fry or toast the bread. To fry, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a separate pan over medium heat. Add the bread pieces and fry until golden brown and crispy. This should take about 3-5 minutes. If you prefer to toast the bread, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and bake the bread pieces on a baking sheet for 10-12 minutes, or until they are crispy.</p><p>Once the bread is crispy, set it aside on a paper towel to absorb any excess oil.</p><h3 id=step-3-preparing-the-yogurt-sauce>Step 3: Preparing the Yogurt Sauce</h3><p>In a small bowl, whisk together the plain yogurt, tahini (if using), lemon juice, minced garlic, salt, and pepper. This creamy yogurt sauce adds a refreshing contrast to the rich flavors of the meat and the crispy bread. If the sauce is too thick, you can thin it out with a little bit of water.</p><h3 id=step-4-assembling-the-fattah>Step 4: Assembling the Fattah</h3><p>Once all the components are prepared, it’s time to assemble your Fattah.</p><p>Start by layering the crispy bread at the bottom of a large serving dish or individual bowls. Spoon some of the cooked meat and its broth over the bread, ensuring the bread soaks up the flavorful juices.</p><p>Next, drizzle a generous amount of the yogurt sauce over the meat. This will add creaminess and tang to each bite. If you like, you can repeat the layers, adding more bread, meat, and yogurt sauce until you’ve used up all the ingredients.</p><h3 id=step-5-garnishing-and-serving>Step 5: Garnishing and Serving</h3><p>Top your Fattah with fresh chopped parsley for a burst of color and freshness. For an added touch of elegance, you can sprinkle toasted pine nuts or almonds on top. If you enjoy a sweet and tangy flavor, pomegranate seeds make a beautiful and tasty garnish.</p><p>Fattah is best served warm, and it pairs wonderfully with a side of Arabic salad, tabbouleh, or pickled vegetables. This dish is sure to be a hit at your next meal, whether you&rsquo;re serving it for a casual family dinner or a special gathering.</p><h2 id=tips-for-making-the-perfect-fattah>Tips for Making the Perfect Fattah</h2><ol><li><p><strong>Choose the Right Meat</strong>: While lamb is a popular choice for traditional Fattah, beef and chicken also work wonderfully. If you prefer a lighter dish, chicken is an excellent option.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adjust the Spices</strong>: The beauty of Fattah lies in the spices, so feel free to adjust the amounts according to your taste. If you love extra warmth, add a pinch of ground cloves or nutmeg.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Fresh Bread</strong>: Using fresh, soft pita bread will yield the best results. Stale bread can become too soggy when layered with the meat and sauce.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make It Ahead</strong>: Fattah can be made ahead of time. You can prepare the meat, bread, and yogurt sauce separately and assemble the dish when ready to serve. This makes it a great option for meal prepping.</p></li><li><p><strong>Experiment with Garnishes</strong>: Garnishes such as crispy fried onions, chopped tomatoes, or even a drizzle of olive oil can add extra flavor and texture to the dish.</p></li></ol><h2 id=why-fattah-is-a-favorite-in-middle-eastern-cuisine>Why Fattah is a Favorite in Middle Eastern Cuisine</h2><p>Fattah is more than just a meal; it’s a dish that brings people together.
