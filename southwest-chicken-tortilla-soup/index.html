Southwest cuisine is known for its use of spices such as cumin, chili powder, and garlic, which give dishes their distinctive, rich taste.

Adding crunchy tortilla strips on top adds a wonderful texture contrast, elevating this dish from just a regular soup to an extraordinary meal.</p><p>Let’s break down the steps for making this Southwest Chicken Tortilla Soup and explore how each ingredient contributes to the flavor and texture of the dish.</p><h2 id=ingredients-youll-need>Ingredients You&rsquo;ll Need</h2><p>To create this mouthwatering soup, gather the following ingredients. Most of these can be found at your local grocery store or farmer’s market.</p><h3 id=for-the-soup>For the Soup:</h3><ul><li><strong>Chicken Breast (or thighs)</strong> – Skinless and boneless are ideal. Chicken breast gives a leaner, milder flavor, but chicken thighs will provide a juicier and richer taste.</li><li><strong>Olive Oil</strong> – For sautéing and infusing the base of the soup with flavor.</li><li><strong>Onion</strong> – Yellow or white onions work well in this recipe. The onions will caramelize slightly during the sauté process, contributing a subtle sweetness.</li><li><strong>Garlic</strong> – Fresh garlic adds a depth of flavor that can’t be substituted with garlic powder.</li><li><strong>Bell Peppers</strong> – Use red and green bell peppers for color and sweetness, which balances out the heat from the other spices.</li><li><strong>Canned Tomatoes</strong> – Use diced tomatoes, preferably with green chilies for a hint of heat and flavor.</li><li><strong>Corn</strong> – You can use frozen or canned corn for a sweet crunch that pairs wonderfully with the soup’s savory ingredients.</li><li><strong>Black Beans</strong> – These add a hearty texture to the soup and boost the protein content.</li><li><strong>Chicken Broth</strong> – A flavorful base that will bring everything together. You can use store-bought or homemade broth, but chicken stock is often preferred for its richness.</li><li><strong>Spices</strong> – Cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, and a pinch of cayenne pepper will bring that signature Southwest flavor. Adjust the amount of cayenne pepper depending on your heat preference.</li><li><strong>Lime</strong> – A squeeze of fresh lime juice will brighten up the soup and add a zing of citrus freshness.</li><li><strong>Fresh Cilantro</strong> – Adds a burst of freshness and herbaceous flavor that complements the spices beautifully.</li><li><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong> – To season the soup to taste.</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-tortilla-strips>For the Tortilla Strips:</h3><ul><li><strong>Corn Tortillas</strong> – These will be sliced into thin strips and fried to create a crunchy topping for your soup.</li><li><strong>Vegetable Oil</strong> – For frying the tortilla strips until they’re golden and crispy.</li></ul><h3 id=optional-toppings>Optional Toppings:</h3><ul><li><strong>Sour Cream</strong> – Adds a creamy, tangy element that balances out the spice.</li><li><strong>Avocado</strong> – Fresh avocado slices or guacamole will give the soup an extra layer of creaminess and richness.</li><li><strong>Shredded Cheese</strong> – A sprinkle of shredded cheddar or Mexican cheese blend can be melted on top for added indulgence.</li><li><strong>Jalapeños</strong> – For extra spice, garnish with freshly sliced jalapeños.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-make-southwest-chicken-tortilla-soup>How to Make Southwest Chicken Tortilla Soup</h2><p>Now that you have all your ingredients, it’s time to start cooking. Let’s walk through each step to make this delicious, comforting soup.</p><h3 id=step-1-sauté-the-aromatics>Step 1: Sauté the Aromatics</h3><p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat up the olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes until the onion becomes soft and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for another 30 seconds, allowing it to release its fragrance. The base of the soup is crucial to building layers of flavor, and this step gives the soup a rich, aromatic foundation.</p><h3 id=step-2-cook-the-chicken>Step 2: Cook the Chicken</h3><p>Next, add the chicken breast or thighs to the pot. Season the chicken with salt, pepper, and a pinch of cumin and chili powder. Let the chicken cook for 5-7 minutes on each side, allowing it to brown slightly. Once the chicken is cooked through, remove it from the pot and set it aside to cool.</p><h3 id=step-3-sauté-the-vegetables>Step 3: Sauté the Vegetables</h3><p>In the same pot, add the bell peppers, corn, and black beans. Cook for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened and lightly browned. This helps to concentrate their flavors and brings out their natural sweetness.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-tomatoes-broth-and-spices>Step 4: Add Tomatoes, Broth, and Spices</h3><p>Once the vegetables have softened, add the canned tomatoes (with their juices), chicken broth, cumin, chili powder, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, and a pinch of salt. Stir well to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</p><h3 id=step-5-shred-the-chicken>Step 5: Shred the Chicken</h3><p>While the soup is simmering, take the cooked chicken and shred it using two forks. Once the chicken is shredded, add it back to the pot and stir it in. Let the soup continue to simmer for another 5 minutes to ensure the chicken is heated through and has absorbed the flavors of the broth.</p><h3 id=step-6-final-touches>Step 6: Final Touches</h3><p>Before serving, stir in the fresh lime juice and cilantro. The lime juice adds a burst of freshness, and the cilantro adds a bright, herbaceous flavor that ties everything together. Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with additional salt, pepper, or chili powder, depending on your preference.</p><h3 id=step-7-prepare-the-tortilla-strips>Step 7: Prepare the Tortilla Strips</h3><p>While the soup is simmering, prepare the tortilla strips. Cut the corn tortillas into thin strips and fry them in vegetable oil until they are golden brown and crispy. This should only take 2-3 minutes, so keep an eye on them. Once fried, remove the strips from the oil and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil.</p><h3 id=step-8-serve-and-garnish>Step 8: Serve and Garnish</h3><p>To serve, ladle the soup into bowls and top with a generous handful of crispy tortilla strips. For an extra layer of flavor, you can add optional toppings like sour cream, shredded cheese, avocado, or sliced jalapeños. The crunchy tortilla strips add a delightful contrast to the creamy broth, and the toppings elevate the dish with extra richness and texture.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-perfect-southwest-chicken-tortilla-soup>Tips for the Perfect Southwest Chicken Tortilla Soup</h2><ul><li><strong>Make It Ahead</strong>: This soup is even better the next day. You can make it ahead and store it in the fridge for up to 3 days. Just be sure to keep the tortilla strips separate until you’re ready to serve so they don’t get soggy.</li><li><strong>Spice Level</strong>: If you like things spicier, feel free to add more cayenne pepper or chopped fresh jalapeños. For a milder version, reduce the cayenne or omit it entirely.</li><li><strong>Use Rotisserie Chicken</strong>: If you&rsquo;re short on time, you can substitute the raw chicken with shredded rotisserie chicken. Simply add the chicken in during the last few minutes of cooking to warm it up.</li><li><strong>Customizable</strong>: Feel free to adjust the vegetables based on what you have on hand. Zucchini, carrots, or even sweet potatoes would work well in this soup.</li><li><strong>Freezing</strong>: This soup freezes beautifully. Store it in an airtight container for up to 3 months.
