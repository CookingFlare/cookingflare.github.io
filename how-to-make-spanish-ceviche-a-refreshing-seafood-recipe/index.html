Though many associate ceviche with Peru, Spain has its own variation of this refreshing seafood dish. Spanish ceviche offers a delightful twist on the classic with its unique preparation method and flavors. If you’ve been searching for a way to cool off on a hot day or are simply craving a light and vibrant meal, Spanish ceviche is the perfect dish to prepare.</p><p>In this post, we will walk you through how to make Spanish ceviche from scratch, providing you with detailed instructions, tips, and suggestions to perfect this seafood masterpiece. Let’s dive into the essential steps and flavors that make Spanish ceviche so special.</p><h2 id=what-is-spanish-ceviche>What is Spanish Ceviche?</h2><p>Ceviche, a popular dish throughout Latin America, typically consists of raw fish or seafood marinated in citrus juices, primarily lime or lemon. This process essentially &ldquo;cooks&rdquo; the seafood, making it safe to eat while retaining a fresh, tender texture. While ceviche is known for its regional variations, the Spanish version uses a variety of fresh fish and seafood, mixed with vegetables like onions, tomatoes, and herbs to elevate the flavor profile. It is served chilled and can be accompanied by side dishes like toasted bread or plantain chips.</p><p>The primary differences between Spanish ceviche and other regional versions, such as Peruvian ceviche, are in the types of seafood used and the inclusion of different seasonings. In Spain, Mediterranean fish like anchovies, mackerel, and squid are often used, and the recipe frequently incorporates olive oil and vinegar for an added depth of flavor.</p><h2 id=ingredients-for-spanish-ceviche>Ingredients for Spanish Ceviche</h2><p>To make Spanish ceviche, you’ll need a variety of fresh ingredients. Quality matters, so be sure to source the freshest fish and seafood available. Here’s a list of ingredients that you’ll need:</p><ul><li><strong>Fresh fish</strong>: Opt for firm, white fish like cod, bass, or snapper. You can also use a mix of seafood such as squid, shrimp, and scallops.</li><li><strong>Fresh lemon or lime juice</strong>: Citrus juice is the key to marinating and &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; the seafood.</li><li><strong>Red onions</strong>: These onions have a mild flavor and add a nice pop of color and texture.</li><li><strong>Tomatoes</strong>: Ripe tomatoes enhance the freshness of the ceviche with their juicy sweetness.</li><li><strong>Olive oil</strong>: Spanish olive oil is ideal for bringing out the dish’s Mediterranean flavors.</li><li><strong>Vinegar</strong>: A touch of vinegar, preferably sherry vinegar, gives the ceviche a tangy kick.</li><li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Minced garlic adds a savory richness to balance the citrus notes.</li><li><strong>Fresh herbs</strong>: Parsley, cilantro, and oregano all add wonderful aromas and flavors to the dish.</li><li><strong>Chili or red pepper flakes</strong>: A pinch of heat can bring the dish to life without overpowering the flavors.</li><li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong>: Essential for seasoning the dish to perfection.</li></ul><h2 id=step-by-step-guide-to-making-spanish-ceviche>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Spanish Ceviche</h2><p>Making Spanish ceviche is a simple process, but the key is using fresh ingredients and allowing the seafood to marinate for just the right amount of time. Follow these steps to create a refreshing dish that’s perfect for a summer meal or a light appetizer.</p><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-seafood>Step 1: Prepare the Seafood</h3><p>The first step in making Spanish ceviche is to prepare the seafood. If you are using fish fillets, make sure they are boneless and skinless. Cut the fish into small, bite-sized cubes, and if you&rsquo;re using shellfish like shrimp or scallops, ensure they are peeled and deveined. For squid, slice it into rings or strips.</p><p>When cutting the seafood, aim for uniform pieces so that they marinate evenly. Fresh seafood is best for ceviche, so make sure you’ve purchased it from a reputable source to ensure its freshness.</p><h3 id=step-2-marinate-the-seafood-in-citrus-juice>Step 2: Marinate the Seafood in Citrus Juice</h3><p>Once the seafood is prepped, it’s time to marinate it in citrus juice. Pour fresh lemon or lime juice over the seafood, making sure it’s completely covered. The acidity from the citrus will start to break down the proteins in the seafood, essentially &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; it.</p><p>Let the seafood sit in the citrus juice for about 15 to 20 minutes. While marinating, the seafood will become opaque and firm to the touch, indicating that it’s been properly “cooked” by the citrus. Don’t let it sit too long, or the seafood may become overly tough.</p><h3 id=step-3-chop-and-prepare-the-vegetables>Step 3: Chop and Prepare the Vegetables</h3><p>While the seafood is marinating, use this time to chop the vegetables. Thinly slice the red onions and chop the tomatoes into small dice. Mince the garlic finely and prepare your fresh herbs by chopping them coarsely. The combination of red onions, tomatoes, and garlic will add a rich flavor base to the ceviche.</p><p>Feel free to adjust the ratio of vegetables to seafood to suit your taste. Some prefer a more veggie-forward ceviche, while others like a seafood-dominant dish.</p><h3 id=step-4-mix-the-vegetables-with-the-marinated-seafood>Step 4: Mix the Vegetables with the Marinated Seafood</h3><p>Once the seafood has marinated for about 15 to 20 minutes, drain off most of the citrus juice, leaving just enough to coat the seafood. Add the chopped vegetables to the marinated seafood mixture. You’ll want to mix everything gently so that the flavors are evenly distributed but the seafood remains intact.</p><p>Add olive oil to the mix, a splash of sherry vinegar, and stir everything together. The olive oil provides a rich, smooth texture, while the vinegar adds a pleasant tanginess to balance out the citrus acidity.</p><h3 id=step-5-season-and-add-fresh-herbs>Step 5: Season and Add Fresh Herbs</h3><p>Now it’s time to add some seasoning to the ceviche. Sprinkle in salt and pepper to taste, and add a pinch of chili flakes or finely chopped fresh chili if you like a bit of heat. Fresh herbs like parsley and cilantro are essential to give the ceviche an aromatic and vibrant flavor. Add the herbs and toss everything together gently.</p><h3 id=step-6-chill-and-serve>Step 6: Chill and Serve</h3><p>Ceviche is best served chilled, so place the prepared ceviche in the refrigerator and let it chill for at least 30 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together and the seafood to soak up the citrus marinade.</p><p>Before serving, taste the ceviche and adjust the seasoning as needed. If you prefer more acidity, you can add a bit more vinegar or lemon juice. If you want a touch more heat, increase the chili or red pepper flakes.</p><p>To serve, spoon the ceviche into small bowls or glasses. Ceviche can be served with various accompaniments like crispy tostadas, crispy plantain chips, or slices of avocado. You can even pair it with a chilled glass of white wine or sangria for a refreshing meal.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-spanish-ceviche>Tips for Perfect Spanish Ceviche</h2><ul><li><strong>Use Fresh Ingredients</strong>: The key to a delicious ceviche is using the freshest seafood and vegetables. Quality seafood makes all the difference, so don’t compromise on freshness.</li><li><strong>Don’t Over-Marinate</strong>: Be careful not to marinate the seafood for too long, as it can become overly tough and rubbery. Typically, 15 to 20 minutes is enough.</li><li><strong>Customize the Heat</strong>: The level of spiciness in ceviche is entirely up to you. If you love spice, add more chili or jalapeños to the dish. If you prefer a milder ceviche, use only a small amount of chili or skip it altogether.</li><li><strong>Serve Immediately</strong>: While ceviche can sit in the fridge for a little while to let the flavors develop, it’s best served within a few hours of preparation. The longer it sits, the more the citrus will break down the seafood.</li></ul><h2 id=variations-of-spanish-ceviche>Variations of Spanish Ceviche</h2><p>While the basic recipe for Spanish ceviche is delicious on its own, there are many ways to customize it based on your preferences or the ingredients available to you. Here are a few variations you can try:</p><ul><li><strong>Add Avocado</strong>: For a creamy element, add some diced avocado to your ceviche right before serving. It complements the fresh seafood and balances the acidity of the citrus.</li><li><strong>Use Other Seafood</strong>: Spanish ceviche can be made with a variety of fish and shellfish. Try using mackerel, anchovies, or even octopus for a different twist.</li><li><strong>Fruit Ceviche</strong>: For a sweet contrast, you can add fruits like mango, pineapple, or orange slices to your ceviche. The sweetness pairs wonderfully with the tangy citrus and seafood.</li></ul><h2 id=why-you-should-try-spanish-ceviche>Why You Should Try Spanish Ceviche</h2><p>Spanish ceviche offers a fresh, healthy, and exciting way to enjoy seafood.
