The creamy texture, earthy flavors, and the satisfaction of knowing you’ve crafted something nutritious and hearty from scratch—this dish has been a staple in kitchens for generations. Whether you&rsquo;re looking to warm up on a chilly evening or seeking a nourishing lunch, split pea soup is the perfect choice. In this post, we&rsquo;ll explore everything you need to know about making split pea soup at home, from choosing the right peas to perfecting the seasoning and technique.</p><h2 id=what-is-split-pea-soup>What is Split Pea Soup?</h2><p>Split pea soup is a delicious, hearty dish made primarily from dried split peas, which are peas that have been peeled, split, and dried. These peas come in green and yellow varieties, with the green peas typically used for a traditional split pea soup. The soup also contains vegetables like onions, carrots, and celery, and is usually simmered with broth and seasoned with herbs and spices. A common ingredient is ham or a ham bone, which imparts a rich, savory flavor to the soup, though there are plenty of vegetarian variations as well.</p><p>Split pea soup is not just comforting; it’s also packed with nutrients. It’s a great source of protein, fiber, and essential vitamins, making it an ideal meal for those looking for something filling and nourishing.</p><h2 id=ingredients-you-will-need-for-the-perfect-split-pea-soup>Ingredients You Will Need for the Perfect Split Pea Soup</h2><p>Before you start making split pea soup, it’s essential to gather your ingredients. The key to a great soup is using fresh, high-quality produce and seasoning it well. Below is a list of the ingredients you&rsquo;ll need:</p><ul><li><strong>2 cups of dried split peas</strong> (green or yellow)</li><li><strong>1 tablespoon olive oil</strong> (or butter, for richness)</li><li><strong>1 large onion</strong>, diced</li><li><strong>2 medium carrots</strong>, peeled and diced</li><li><strong>2 celery stalks</strong>, chopped</li><li><strong>3 garlic cloves</strong>, minced</li><li><strong>1 bay leaf</strong></li><li><strong>1 teaspoon dried thyme</strong> (or 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, if available)</li><li><strong>6 cups vegetable broth</strong> (or chicken broth for a non-vegetarian option)</li><li><strong>1 smoked ham hock</strong> or 2 cups diced cooked ham (optional for vegetarians)</li><li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong> to taste</li><li><strong>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</strong> (optional for brightness)</li><li><strong>Fresh parsley</strong> for garnish</li></ul><p>These ingredients work together to create a soup that is flavorful, hearty, and satisfying. You can easily tweak this recipe by adding other vegetables or changing up the herbs and spices depending on your preferences.</p><h2 id=how-to-make-comforting-homemade-split-pea-soup>How to Make Comforting Homemade Split Pea Soup</h2><p>Making split pea soup is an easy process, though it does require some patience while the peas soften and the flavors meld together. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to make your own batch of homemade split pea soup.</p><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-split-peas>Step 1: Prepare the Split Peas</h3><p>Start by sorting through the dried split peas to remove any debris, such as small stones or damaged peas. Rinse the peas under cold water to clean them. This is a crucial step, as it ensures that the peas are free from impurities and ready to cook.</p><h3 id=step-2-sauté-the-vegetables>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3><p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil (or butter) over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the diced onions, carrots, and celery. Sauté the vegetables for about 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they begin to soften and the onions turn translucent.</p><p>Next, add the minced garlic and cook for another minute, until fragrant. This will enhance the flavor of your soup and provide a wonderful aroma as it cooks.</p><h3 id=step-3-add-the-split-peas-and-seasonings>Step 3: Add the Split Peas and Seasonings</h3><p>Add the rinsed split peas to the pot, stirring them in with the sautéed vegetables. Sprinkle in the dried thyme and place the bay leaf in the pot as well. If you are using a smoked ham hock or diced ham, add it at this point as well. The ham adds depth of flavor and a touch of smokiness that enhances the overall taste of the soup.</p><h3 id=step-4-simmer-the-soup>Step 4: Simmer the Soup</h3><p>Pour in the vegetable or chicken broth, ensuring that the ingredients are fully submerged. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat. Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the soup simmer gently for about 1 to 1.5 hours. During this time, the split peas will break down, creating a thick and creamy texture. Stir occasionally to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot.</p><p>If you’re using a ham hock, make sure to remove it once the peas are fully cooked. You can pull off the meat from the bone, shred it, and return it to the soup, adding more richness and flavor.</p><h3 id=step-5-blend-the-soup-optional>Step 5: Blend the Soup (Optional)</h3><p>Once the peas have softened and the soup has thickened to your liking, you can choose to blend the soup for a smoother consistency. Some people prefer a chunky texture with the peas still intact, while others like a velvety, creamier soup.</p><p>To blend, you can either use an immersion blender directly in the pot or transfer the soup in batches to a regular blender. Be cautious when blending hot liquids; allow the soup to cool slightly before blending to avoid splashing. If you like, you can blend only a portion of the soup to retain some texture while still achieving a creamy base.</p><h3 id=step-6-season-and-serve>Step 6: Season and Serve</h3><p>Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning. If needed, add salt and freshly ground black pepper to bring out the flavors. If you’re looking for an extra burst of brightness, a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice can help balance the richness of the soup.</p><p>Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with freshly chopped parsley for a pop of color and added freshness.</p><h3 id=step-7-enjoy>Step 7: Enjoy!</h3><p>Your homemade split pea soup is ready to be served! Pair it with some crusty bread for a complete meal, or enjoy it on its own for a satisfying and healthy dish. The soup will continue to thicken as it sits, so feel free to add a bit more broth if you prefer a thinner consistency when reheating.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-split-pea-soup-every-time>Tips for Perfect Split Pea Soup Every Time</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Use homemade broth</strong>: For a more flavorful soup, consider making your own broth. It’s easier than you might think and can be a great way to use up vegetable scraps or leftover meat bones.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t skip the ham</strong>: While you can make a vegetarian version of split pea soup, the addition of ham or a ham bone really takes the flavor to the next level.

Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge, and reheat gently on the stove.</p></li><li><p><strong>Freezing leftovers</strong>: Split pea soup freezes beautifully. If you have a batch that you can’t finish in one sitting, store it in a freezer-safe container. To reheat, thaw overnight in the fridge and heat gently on the stove.</p></li></ul><h2 id=nutritional-benefits-of-split-pea-soup>Nutritional Benefits of Split Pea Soup</h2><p>Not only is split pea soup delicious, but it’s also incredibly nutritious.

You can also add a few extra vegetables, like potatoes or zucchini, for a unique twist.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spicy split pea soup</strong>: For a little heat, add some diced jalapeños or a pinch of cayenne pepper.
