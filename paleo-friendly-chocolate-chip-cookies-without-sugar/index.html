One such treat that has stood the test of time is the classic chocolate chip cookie. However, for those following a Paleo lifestyle or simply trying to avoid refined sugar, traditional chocolate chip cookies aren&rsquo;t always an option. But fear not—there&rsquo;s a way to enjoy this classic dessert without sacrificing taste or health benefits.</p><p>In this post, we&rsquo;re diving into a mouthwatering recipe for Paleo-friendly chocolate chip cookies without sugar. These cookies are made with wholesome ingredients that align with the Paleo diet, using natural sweeteners and a blend of nut flours for that soft, chewy texture. If you&rsquo;re someone who loves to indulge in a treat without derailing your health goals, then this recipe is a game changer.</p><h3 id=why-choose-paleo-friendly-chocolate-chip-cookies>Why Choose Paleo-Friendly Chocolate Chip Cookies?</h3><p>The Paleo diet focuses on eating whole foods that are nutrient-dense and free from processed sugars, grains, and dairy. By eliminating refined sugar, you&rsquo;re avoiding the negative impacts that sugar can have on your blood sugar levels, insulin, and overall health. Instead, Paleo desserts and baked goods rely on natural alternatives, like honey, maple syrup, or coconut sugar, to add sweetness without compromising on the nutritional profile.</p><p>In this recipe, we&rsquo;ve taken things a step further by removing even the natural sugars and using an alternative sweetener that won&rsquo;t spike your blood sugar. The result is a dessert that&rsquo;s not only Paleo-friendly but also low-glycemic and free from added sugars.</p><h3 id=ingredients-for-paleo-friendly-chocolate-chip-cookies>Ingredients for Paleo-Friendly Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3><p>To make these chocolate chip cookies, you&rsquo;ll need the following ingredients:</p><ul><li><strong>Almond Flour</strong>: This nut-based flour is a staple in Paleo baking. It provides a rich, nutty flavor and a moist texture to cookies, without the gluten found in wheat-based flour.</li><li><strong>Coconut Flour</strong>: A little coconut flour goes a long way in Paleo baking, adding structure and a slight coconut flavor. It&rsquo;s also naturally high in fiber and absorbs moisture, giving your cookies a perfectly chewy texture.</li><li><strong>Baking Soda</strong>: This will help your cookies rise and spread, giving them the perfect soft and chewy consistency.</li><li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs provide moisture and help bind all the ingredients together. They also add a bit of richness to the flavor.</li><li><strong>Coconut Oil</strong>: A great fat source for Paleo baked goods. It adds moisture to the dough and a subtle coconut flavor. Plus, it helps your cookies stay soft.</li><li><strong>Sugar-Free Chocolate Chips</strong>: You can find sugar-free chocolate chips that are sweetened with stevia or erythritol. These options keep the recipe completely sugar-free while still delivering the rich chocolate flavor we all love.</li><li><strong>Vanilla Extract</strong>: A small amount of vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor profile and complements the chocolate chips.</li><li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt is crucial to balance the sweetness and bring out the richness of the other ingredients.</li><li><strong>Optional – Chopped Nuts</strong>: If you love a little extra crunch, you can add in chopped almonds, walnuts, or pecans. These are not only delicious but also give your cookies an extra dose of healthy fats and protein.</li></ul><h3 id=step-by-step-instructions-for-baking-paleo-chocolate-chip-cookies>Step-by-Step Instructions for Baking Paleo Chocolate Chip Cookies</h3><p>Now that you&rsquo;ve gathered all the ingredients, it&rsquo;s time to get baking! Follow these simple steps to make your own Paleo-friendly chocolate chip cookies without sugar:</p><h4 id=step-1-preheat-the-oven>Step 1: Preheat the Oven</h4><p>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to ensure your cookies don’t stick to the pan.</p><h4 id=step-2-mix-the-wet-ingredients>Step 2: Mix the Wet Ingredients</h4><p>In a large bowl, combine the eggs, coconut oil, and vanilla extract. Use a hand whisk or stand mixer to beat them together until well incorporated and smooth. The coconut oil should be melted but not too hot—just warm enough to mix easily with the other ingredients.</p><h4 id=step-3-combine-the-dry-ingredients>Step 3: Combine the Dry Ingredients</h4><p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond flour, coconut flour, baking soda, and salt. Make sure there are no lumps in the flour mixture. The almond flour will give the cookies their chewy texture, while the coconut flour helps absorb moisture and hold everything together.</p><h4 id=step-4-mix-wet-and-dry-ingredients-together>Step 4: Mix Wet and Dry Ingredients Together</h4><p>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and stir well. The dough should come together nicely, but it may be slightly thicker than traditional cookie dough. This is normal due to the absence of refined sugar and flour. If the dough seems too dry, you can add a tablespoon of water or additional coconut oil to help bring it together.</p><h4 id=step-5-fold-in-the-chocolate-chips>Step 5: Fold in the Chocolate Chips</h4><p>Once the dough is mixed, fold in the sugar-free chocolate chips. You can also add any optional chopped nuts here, if you like. Stir until everything is evenly distributed throughout the dough.</p><h4 id=step-6-scoop-the-dough-onto-the-baking-sheet>Step 6: Scoop the Dough onto the Baking Sheet</h4><p>Using a tablespoon or a cookie scoop, portion out the dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Space the cookies about 2 inches apart, as they will spread slightly as they bake. If you prefer larger cookies, feel free to use a bit more dough per cookie.</p><h4 id=step-7-bake-the-cookies>Step 7: Bake the Cookies</h4><p>Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the cookies for 8-10 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Keep an eye on them to avoid overbaking, as almond flour cookies can brown quickly. The centers may still appear soft, but they will firm up as they cool.</p><h4 id=step-8-let-the-cookies-cool>Step 8: Let the Cookies Cool</h4><p>Once the cookies are done, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes. Then, transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. This will help them set and become even chewier.</p><h3 id=why-these-cookies-are-a-healthier-option>Why These Cookies Are a Healthier Option</h3><p>Paleo chocolate chip cookies without sugar are not just delicious—they’re a much healthier option than traditional cookies.

However, keep in mind that these cookies are meant to be naturally sweetened without any added sugars.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cookie Size</strong>: For chewy cookies, make sure to space the dough about 2 inches apart, but if you want crispier cookies, you can flatten the dough slightly before baking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Storage</strong>: Store these cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days. If you want them to last longer, you can refrigerate them for up to a week or freeze them for up to 3 months.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add Ins</strong>: Feel free to get creative with the ingredients!
