While the turkey and stuffing often take the spotlight, side dishes play a crucial role in rounding out the meal. One side dish that consistently wins over hearts and taste buds is <strong>Green Bean Almondine</strong>. This vibrant, elegant dish is a perfect balance of tender green beans, crunchy almonds, and a buttery, lemony sauce that adds a burst of flavor to your Thanksgiving feast.</p><p>In this blog post, we&rsquo;ll walk you through everything you need to know to make a delicious <strong>Green Bean Almondine</strong> for Thanksgiving. Whether you&rsquo;re an experienced cook or someone looking for a simple yet sophisticated side dish to serve, this recipe is sure to impress.</p><h2 id=ingredients-for-green-bean-almondine>Ingredients for Green Bean Almondine</h2><p>Before diving into the preparation process, let’s make sure you have everything on hand. This dish uses a short list of ingredients, making it both simple and flavorful:</p><ul><li><strong>1 pound of fresh green beans</strong> (trimmed and washed)</li><li><strong>1/2 cup of sliced almonds</strong></li><li><strong>2 tablespoons of unsalted butter</strong></li><li><strong>1 tablespoon of olive oil</strong> (optional, for added richness)</li><li><strong>2 cloves of garlic</strong> (minced)</li><li><strong>1 tablespoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice</strong> (or zest for extra lemon flavor)</li><li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong>, to taste</li><li><strong>1 teaspoon of lemon zest</strong> (optional, for extra brightness)</li><li><strong>Fresh parsley</strong> (for garnish, optional)</li></ul><p>When selecting green beans for this dish, aim for fresh, crisp beans that snap when bent. They should be vibrant green in color, free from blemishes. Frozen green beans can be used in a pinch, but fresh green beans will yield the best results.</p><h2 id=how-to-prepare-green-bean-almondine>How to Prepare Green Bean Almondine</h2><h3 id=step-1-trim-and-prep-the-green-beans>Step 1: Trim and Prep the Green Beans</h3><p>Start by preparing your green beans. To do this, snap off the stem ends of the beans or use a paring knife to trim them. If you prefer a uniform look, you can cut the beans to a desired length, but most people enjoy leaving them whole for a more rustic presentation.</p><p>After trimming the green beans, rinse them under cold water and set them aside. You’ll want to have a large bowl of ice water ready for later, which will help preserve the green beans&rsquo; vibrant color and crispness once they’re blanched.</p><h3 id=step-2-blanch-the-green-beans>Step 2: Blanch the Green Beans</h3><p>Blanching is the key to ensuring that the green beans remain tender yet still retain some of their snap. To do this, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once boiling, add the prepared green beans and cook for 3-5 minutes, depending on how tender you like them.</p><p>As the green beans cook, prepare an ice bath by filling a large bowl with ice and cold water. Once the green beans are done, quickly transfer them from the boiling water to the ice bath. This immediate cooling process helps stop the cooking and locks in the green beans&rsquo; bright green color.</p><p>After about 3-4 minutes, drain the green beans and set them aside. At this point, they should be tender but still crisp and vibrant.</p><h3 id=step-3-toast-the-almonds>Step 3: Toast the Almonds</h3><p>The almonds are a crucial element in the flavor and texture of this dish. Start by heating a dry skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced almonds and toast them for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally to ensure they don’t burn.</p><p>You’ll know they’re ready when they turn a golden brown color and emit a delightful nutty aroma. Be sure to keep a close eye on them, as almonds can burn quickly. Once toasted, remove the almonds from the skillet and set them aside.</p><h3 id=step-4-sauté-the-garlic>Step 4: Sauté the Garlic</h3><p>In the same skillet you used to toast the almonds, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the olive oil at this point if you prefer a richer flavor, but the butter alone will suffice.</p><p>Once the butter has melted and started to bubble, add the minced garlic. Sauté the garlic for about 30 seconds, just long enough for it to become fragrant and golden. Be careful not to let the garlic brown, as this can turn it bitter and affect the overall flavor of the dish.</p><h3 id=step-5-combine-the-green-beans-and-almonds>Step 5: Combine the Green Beans and Almonds</h3><p>Once the garlic is fragrant, add the blanched green beans to the skillet. Toss the beans gently in the garlic butter mixture to coat them evenly. Cook the green beans for another 2-3 minutes, just long enough for them to heat through and absorb the buttery garlic flavor.</p><p>At this point, it’s time to add the toasted almonds. Sprinkle the almonds over the green beans and toss gently to combine. The almonds will add a lovely crunch and nutty flavor that contrasts beautifully with the tender green beans.</p><h3 id=step-6-add-lemon-juice-and-season>Step 6: Add Lemon Juice and Season</h3><p>For that signature refreshing touch, drizzle the freshly squeezed lemon juice over the green beans and toss them gently. The acidity of the lemon juice balances the richness of the butter and garlic, adding a burst of brightness to the dish.</p><p>Season the green bean almondine with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. You can also add a little more lemon zest if you want to enhance the lemony flavor. Give the dish one final toss to ensure everything is well combined.</p><h3 id=step-7-garnish-and-serve>Step 7: Garnish and Serve</h3><p>Transfer the green bean almondine to a serving platter. For a pop of color and added flavor, garnish the dish with freshly chopped parsley. This adds a fresh, herby note that complements the green beans perfectly.</p><p>Serve your green bean almondine alongside your Thanksgiving turkey, mashed potatoes, and other holiday favorites. The crispness of the green beans, combined with the nutty almonds and lemony butter sauce, will elevate your meal and add a burst of flavor to your Thanksgiving spread.</p><h2 id=tips-for-making-the-best-green-bean-almondine>Tips for Making the Best Green Bean Almondine</h2><ul><li><strong>For Extra Flavor:</strong> If you want to add a little more depth of flavor, you can sauté the green beans with a tablespoon of shallots or onion in the garlic butter mixture.</li><li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> Green bean almondine can be partially made ahead. You can blanch the green beans, toast the almonds, and sauté the garlic ahead of time. Simply combine everything and heat it through just before serving.</li><li><strong>Customize Your Nuts:</strong> While almonds are traditional in this dish, you can experiment with other nuts like pecans, walnuts, or cashews for a unique twist.</li><li><strong>Add a Crunchy Element:</strong> If you like a bit more crunch, consider sprinkling some crispy fried onions on top right before serving. They will add a savory, crispy contrast to the tender beans.</li><li><strong>Vegan Version:</strong> To make this dish vegan-friendly, simply swap out the butter for vegan butter or olive oil, and you’ve got a delicious plant-based side dish that everyone can enjoy.</li></ul><h2 id=why-green-bean-almondine-is-the-perfect-thanksgiving-side-dish>Why Green Bean Almondine Is the Perfect Thanksgiving Side Dish</h2><p>Thanksgiving is all about balance, and <strong>green bean almondine</strong> offers just the right mix of fresh vegetables, crunch, and flavor to complement heavier dishes like turkey and stuffing.
