From the pre-Columbian era to the present day, Mexican cooking has evolved through the adaptation and integration of various traditions, evolving into a unique and flavorful culinary art. In this article, we will embark on a journey through the history of Mexican cuisine, exploring its origins, key ingredients, and notable dishes, highlighting the complex and delicious story of its development.
Pre-Columbian Era
The earliest evidence of cooking in Mexico dates back to around 2000 BCE, during the formation of the Mesoamerican civilization. The ancient Mayans and Aztecs were skilled cooks, using a variety of ingredients such as corn, beans, squash, chilies, and turkey to create a multitude of dishes. These basic staples were often combined with other local ingredients like avocados, papayas, and coconut, forming a distinct Mesoamerican cuisine.
In their cooking, these indigenous cultures revered specific ingredients such as corn, sunflower seeds, and cacao, which held spiritual and nutritional value. These ingredients were often used in intricate rituals and ceremonies, demonstrating the significance of food in pre-Columbian society. Tablecloths, wooden utensils, and earthenware pots show us how they prepared meals with creativity and purpose, using traditional cooking techniques that can be seen in historical archaeological records.
Spanish Colonization (1519-1821)
When the Spanish arrived in Mexico in the early 16th century, local cuisine underwent a profound transformation. The Spanish conquistadors introduced new ingredients like pork, beef, chicken, and sheep, which became staples in Mexican cooking. The introduction of European cooking techniques, such as frying and roasting, also influenced the way Mexicans cooked their food. This period saw the extreme atrophication of much pre-Columbian culinary knowledge and cooking methods.
The encounter between the Spanish and indigenous cuisine led to the exchange and adaptation of spices, cooking techniques, and ingredients. Cheese, chard, and light bread in meals resembled an importation of medieval European ideas from the Castillian and Provençe regions, together with Christianity, it brought temporary cultural unity with new corn tortillas after capturing South America.
