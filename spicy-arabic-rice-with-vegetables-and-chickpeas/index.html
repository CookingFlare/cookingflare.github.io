In countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, and Jordan, rice dishes are often prepared with vegetables, legumes, and a blend of spices that infuse the rice with deep flavors. Chickpeas are a popular ingredient in the Middle East, used in everything from stews to salads to rice dishes. They add a rich, nutty flavor and are an excellent source of plant-based protein.</p><p>Spicy Arabic Rice with Vegetables and Chickpeas is a celebration of the region’s culinary traditions, combining ingredients that are both nutritious and comforting. The spice blend used in this dish reflects the typical flavors of Arabic cuisine, with ingredients like cumin, cinnamon, turmeric, and paprika.</p><h2 id=why-youll-love-this-dish>Why You’ll Love This Dish</h2><h3 id=a-one-pot-meal>A One-Pot Meal</h3><p>One of the best things about this dish is that it’s a one-pot meal, meaning minimal cleanup after cooking. The vegetables, chickpeas, and rice all cook together, allowing the flavors to meld beautifully.</p><h3 id=versatile>Versatile</h3><p>This recipe is highly versatile. You can adjust the level of spiciness to your liking, and you can easily swap in different vegetables depending on what you have on hand. You can even make it vegan or add some protein, such as chicken or lamb, to make it heartier.</p><h3 id=healthy-and-nutritious>Healthy and Nutritious</h3><p>Packed with fiber from the chickpeas and vegetables, and a good source of carbohydrates from the rice, this dish is both nourishing and satisfying. The spices not only add flavor but also offer health benefits. For example, turmeric contains curcumin, a compound with powerful anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, chickpeas are an excellent source of protein and can help support digestive health.</p><h3 id=perfect-for-meal-prep>Perfect for Meal Prep</h3><p>This dish stores well in the refrigerator, making it an ideal option for meal prepping. You can prepare a large batch and enjoy it throughout the week for lunches or dinners. Plus, it tastes even better the next day as the flavors continue to develop.</p><h2 id=ingredients-youll-need>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2><p>To make Spicy Arabic Rice with Vegetables and Chickpeas, gather the following ingredients:</p><ul><li><strong>1 cup long-grain rice</strong> (preferably basmati or jasmine)</li><li><strong>1 can (15 oz) chickpeas</strong>, drained and rinsed</li><li><strong>2 tablespoons olive oil</strong></li><li><strong>1 large onion</strong>, finely chopped</li><li><strong>2 cloves garlic</strong>, minced</li><li><strong>1 large carrot</strong>, diced</li><li><strong>1 bell pepper</strong>, diced</li><li><strong>1 zucchini</strong>, diced</li><li><strong>1 cup frozen peas</strong></li><li><strong>2 tomatoes</strong>, diced (or 1 can of diced tomatoes)</li><li><strong>1 teaspoon ground cumin</strong></li><li><strong>1 teaspoon ground coriander</strong></li><li><strong>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</strong></li><li><strong>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</strong></li><li><strong>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</strong></li><li><strong>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</strong> (optional, adjust to taste)</li><li><strong>1/2 teaspoon salt</strong> (or to taste)</li><li><strong>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</strong></li><li><strong>2 cups vegetable broth</strong> (or water)</li><li><strong>1/4 cup fresh cilantro</strong>, chopped (for garnish)</li><li><strong>Lemon wedges</strong>, for serving</li></ul><h2 id=step-by-step-instructions>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-rice>Step 1: Prepare the Rice</h3><p>Start by rinsing your rice under cold water to remove excess starch. This helps the rice cook more evenly and prevents it from becoming too sticky. Once rinsed, set it aside to drain.</p><h3 id=step-2-sauté-the-vegetables>Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables</h3><p>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, and sauté until softened and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes. Add the diced carrot, bell pepper, and zucchini. Stir occasionally and cook for another 5-7 minutes, until the vegetables are slightly tender but still vibrant in color.</p><h3 id=step-3-add-the-spices>Step 3: Add the Spices</h3><p>Once the vegetables are tender, it’s time to add the spices. Sprinkle in the cumin, coriander, cinnamon, turmeric, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper. Stir everything together and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes. This allows the spices to toast and become aromatic, releasing their full flavors.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-the-tomatoes-and-chickpeas>Step 4: Add the Tomatoes and Chickpeas</h3><p>Add the diced tomatoes (or canned tomatoes) to the pot, along with the chickpeas. Stir everything together, making sure the vegetables and chickpeas are coated in the spices. Let the mixture cook for 5-6 minutes, allowing the tomatoes to break down slightly and create a rich sauce.</p><h3 id=step-5-add-the-rice-and-broth>Step 5: Add the Rice and Broth</h3><p>Add the rinsed rice to the pot and stir it into the vegetable mixture, ensuring the rice is well-coated with the spices and juices from the tomatoes. Pour in the vegetable broth (or water), and give everything a good stir. Bring the mixture to a boil.</p><h3 id=step-6-simmer-the-rice>Step 6: Simmer the Rice</h3><p>Once the broth is boiling, reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and let the rice simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid has been absorbed. Avoid lifting the lid too often during this process, as it will let the steam escape and affect the cooking time.</p><h3 id=step-7-add-the-peas>Step 7: Add the Peas</h3><p>Five minutes before the rice is done, add the frozen peas to the pot. Stir them in gently, and allow them to cook with the rice for the remaining time. The peas will add a burst of sweetness and color to the dish.</p><h3 id=step-8-fluff-and-serve>Step 8: Fluff and Serve</h3><p>Once the rice is cooked, remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Fluff the rice with a fork, then transfer it to serving plates. Garnish with freshly chopped cilantro and serve with lemon wedges on the side for a zesty kick.</p><h2 id=tips-for-success>Tips for Success</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Rice Type:</strong> Basmati rice works best for this dish due to its light, fragrant nature, but you can also use jasmine rice or another long-grain variety if needed. Just ensure that the rice is well-rinsed before cooking to prevent it from becoming too sticky.</p></li><li><p><strong>Adjusting Spice Levels:</strong> If you prefer a milder version, reduce or omit the cayenne pepper. Alternatively, if you love spicy food, feel free to add extra cayenne or even a chopped chili pepper for more heat.</p></li><li><p><strong>Protein Additions:</strong> If you&rsquo;d like to add some protein to the dish, grilled chicken, lamb, or beef would be a great addition. Simply cook the protein separately and serve it alongside or on top of the rice.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vegan Option:</strong> This recipe is naturally vegan and gluten-free, making it a great option for anyone with dietary restrictions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Meal Prep:</strong> This dish stores well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. You can reheat it in the microwave or on the stovetop with a splash of water or broth to prevent it from drying out.</p></li></ul><h2 id=health-benefits-of-spicy-arabic-rice-with-vegetables-and-chickpeas>Health Benefits of Spicy Arabic Rice with Vegetables and Chickpeas</h2><p>This dish is not only delicious but also packed with health benefits:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Chickpeas</strong> are an excellent source of plant-based protein, fiber, and essential vitamins and minerals like folate, iron, and manganese.
