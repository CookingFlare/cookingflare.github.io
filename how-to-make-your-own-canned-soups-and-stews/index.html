But have you ever considered making your own canned versions? It’s a fantastic way to enjoy the taste of homemade food with the convenience of a ready-to-eat meal, and it’s simpler than you might think. Whether you’re looking to preserve your seasonal produce, create hearty meals for the winter, or avoid the high sodium content of store-bought cans, making your own canned soups and stews can be a game-changer.</p><p>In this comprehensive guide, we’ll walk you through the process of creating your own canned soups and stews from scratch, from choosing the right ingredients to the canning process itself. You’ll also find tips for customizing your recipes to fit your dietary needs and preferences.</p><h3 id=the-benefits-of-canning-soups-and-stews-at-home>The Benefits of Canning Soups and Stews at Home</h3><p>Before diving into the recipe-making process, let’s first look at why canning your own soups and stews is worth the effort.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Control Over Ingredients</strong>: By making your own soups and stews, you can control exactly what goes into each batch. You can avoid preservatives, artificial flavors, and the excessive amounts of salt that often come with store-bought canned goods.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cost-Effective</strong>: Canning at home can save you money, especially if you buy in bulk or use seasonal vegetables. While the initial investment in canning equipment may seem pricey, the cost per can of homemade soup or stew is often far less than buying it from the store.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customization</strong>: Homemade canned soups and stews are completely customizable. You can adjust the seasoning to your liking, experiment with different proteins, or go vegetarian. You also have full control over how thick or thin your stews are and can adjust the texture to your preference.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shelf-Stable Convenience</strong>: With proper canning techniques, your homemade soups and stews can last for months or even up to a year on the shelf. This makes them perfect for meal prepping or stocking up for the colder months.</p></li></ol><h3 id=essential-equipment-for-canning-soups-and-stews>Essential Equipment for Canning Soups and Stews</h3><p>Before you start cooking, it’s essential to have the right tools. The process of canning involves sealing food in jars to keep it preserved for an extended period, so the equipment needs to be reliable and efficient. Here’s what you’ll need:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Canning Jars</strong>: Glass jars with a tight-fitting lid are the most common choice for canning. You can find specific canning jars that are designed to withstand the high heat involved in the canning process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Canning Lids and Bands</strong>: The lid needs to create an airtight seal, while the band holds the lid in place during the canning process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pressure Canner</strong>: Unlike water bath canning (which works for high-acid foods like fruits and jams), soups and stews require a pressure canner. This is because the food needs to reach a high enough temperature to kill any harmful bacteria, and pressure canning allows for that at a safe, consistent temperature.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jar Lifter</strong>: A jar lifter is a handy tool for safely removing jars from the canning pot when they’re hot.</p></li><li><p><strong>Funnel</strong>: A wide-mouth funnel makes filling the jars easier without spilling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bubble Remover/Headspace Tool</strong>: This tool ensures that there’s the correct amount of air space at the top of the jar, which is critical for a proper seal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tongs</strong>: For handling hot jars and lids, tongs help to prevent burns and ensure you’re working safely.</p></li></ul><h3 id=how-to-make-homemade-soups-and-stews-for-canning>How to Make Homemade Soups and Stews for Canning</h3><p>The first step in making canned soups and stews is to cook the base. This means preparing your ingredients, seasoning, and letting everything come together into a hearty, flavorful meal. You can adapt your recipes based on personal preferences and dietary needs. Here are the basic steps to follow:</p><h4 id=1-prepare-the-ingredients>1. Prepare the Ingredients</h4><p>Start by gathering the ingredients for your soup or stew. You can mix and match based on your tastes, but here’s a basic structure for both soups and stews:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Protein</strong>: Choose from beef, chicken, pork, or even vegetarian options like beans or tofu. Meats like chicken thighs, beef stew meat, or pork shoulder are common choices for stews. For soups, shredded chicken or ground beef work well.</p></li><li><p><strong>Vegetables</strong>: Onions, carrots, celery, potatoes, tomatoes, peas, corn, green beans, and sweet potatoes are common choices. You can also add greens like spinach or kale.</p></li><li><p><strong>Liquid</strong>: Broths (vegetable, chicken, or beef) are typically used, but you can also use water or a combination of broth and tomato puree for added depth of flavor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seasonings and Herbs</strong>: Salt, pepper, garlic, bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, basil, oregano, and other dried herbs are essential for flavor. Make sure to taste-test as you go to find the perfect balance of seasoning.</p></li><li><p><strong>Other Add-ins</strong>: Depending on your recipe, you might want to add pasta, rice, beans, or lentils to bulk up your stew. Keep in mind that pasta and rice can absorb a lot of liquid, so you may need to adjust the amount of broth you use.</p></li></ul><h4 id=2-cook-your-soup-or-stew-base>2. Cook Your Soup or Stew Base</h4><p>Once your ingredients are prepped, it&rsquo;s time to cook everything. For stews, you’ll typically brown your meat first to build flavor before adding vegetables and liquid. For soups, you can either sauté the vegetables first or add them directly to the broth.</p><p>Here’s a simple step-by-step process for making a classic beef stew:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Brown the Meat</strong>: Heat a bit of oil in a large pot and brown your stew meat in batches. This will help to lock in flavor and give the meat a rich color.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add Vegetables</strong>: Add onions, carrots, and celery to the pot. Sauté until softened, about 5-7 minutes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add Liquid and Simmer</strong>: Pour in your broth and any other liquid (wine, water, or tomato paste). Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for about 1 hour, or until the meat is tender.</p></li><li><p><strong>Season</strong>: Add garlic, salt, pepper, and any other herbs you’re using. Continue simmering for another 10-15 minutes to let the flavors meld.</p></li><li><p><strong>Final Adjustments</strong>: If you’re adding beans, rice, or potatoes, now is the time to add them. Let everything cook until fully tender.</p></li></ol><h4 id=3-prepare-for-canning>3. Prepare for Canning</h4><p>While the soup or stew is cooking, prepare your canning jars. Make sure they are clean and sterilized to prevent contamination. You can sterilize your jars by running them through the dishwasher or by boiling them in water for 10 minutes.</p><p>Once your stew or soup has finished cooking, it’s time to fill your jars.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Fill the Jars</strong>: Use a ladle to fill each jar with the soup or stew. Be sure to leave about 1 inch of headspace at the top of the jar. This space is crucial for allowing the food to expand during the canning process.</p></li><li><p><strong>Remove Air Bubbles</strong>: Use a bubble remover tool or a plastic spatula to gently stir around the edges of the jar. This ensures that any air bubbles are released and that the liquid fills the jar evenly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wipe the Rims</strong>: Use a clean cloth to wipe the rims of each jar, making sure they are free of food residue. This ensures a proper seal when the lid is placed on.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seal the Jars</strong>: Place a canning lid on top of each jar and screw on the band until it&rsquo;s fingertip tight. Don’t overtighten the lids, as this can interfere with the sealing process.</p></li></ol><h4 id=4-canning-the-soups-and-stews>4. Canning the Soups and Stews</h4><p>Now it’s time to process the jars using a pressure canner. The high heat from the pressure canner kills bacteria and seals the jars so that they can be stored safely for months.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Prepare the Pressure Canner</strong>: Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for your pressure canner. Typically, you’ll add a few inches of water to the bottom of the canner, then place the jars on the rack inside.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seal and Heat</strong>: Lock the lid onto the canner and heat it on medium-high until steam begins to escape. Once steam is steady, place the weighted gauge on top or follow your canner’s specific instructions for pressure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Process the Jars</strong>: The processing time will vary depending on your ingredients. For beef stew, for example, the jars typically need to process for 75 minutes at 10-11 pounds of pressure. Refer to a trusted canning guide for specific times based on your recipe.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cool Down</strong>: After the processing time is up, turn off the heat and allow the pressure canner to cool down naturally. Once the pressure has normalized, carefully remove the jars using your jar lifter and let them cool completely on a clean, dry towel.</p></li></ol><h4 id=5-store-your-canned-soups-and-stews>5. Store Your Canned Soups and Stews</h4><p>Once the jars are cool, you should hear a “pop” sound as the lids seal. Check the seal by pressing on the center of the lid. If it doesn’t move, the jar is sealed properly.</p><p>Store your sealed jars in a cool, dark place—such as a pantry or cupboard. They can be safely stored for up to a year, but it’s best to consume them within 6-12 months for the best flavor.</p><h3 id=tips-for-canning-soups-and-stews>Tips for Canning Soups and Stews</h3><ul><li><strong>Don’t Overfill</strong>: Always leave the recommended headspace at the top of the jar to ensure proper sealing.</li><li><strong>Avoid Dairy</strong>: Canning soups or stews with dairy (like cream or milk) isn’t recommended because dairy doesn’t hold up well during the canning process.</li><li><strong>Test Before Storing</strong>: After a few days, test the seals by pressing down in the center of each lid. If it pops up, refrigerate that jar and use it soon.</li><li><strong>Label Your Jars</strong>: Be sure to label your jars with the type of soup or stew and the date you canned it. This will help you keep track of freshness.</li></ul><h3 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h3><p>Making your own canned soups and stews is a rewarding and practical way to enjoy homemade meals year-round. With a little bit of planning and the right equipment, you can stock up on delicious, wholesome soups and stews that are perfect for busy days or cozy nights. The next time you’re craving a hearty meal, just grab a jar off the shelf and enjoy a homemade treat in minutes!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/categories/preserving-and-canning/>Preserving and Canning</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/how-to-make-perfect-strawberry-jam-and-preserve-it/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>How to Make Perfect Strawberry Jam and Preserve It</span>
