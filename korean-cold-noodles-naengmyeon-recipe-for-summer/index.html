A dish that perfectly balances the heat of the season, Naengmyeon is a popular Korean dish known for its delightful combination of chilled, slippery noodles and an array of vibrant, tangy toppings. Whether you&rsquo;re a seasoned lover of Korean cuisine or someone eager to try something new, this recipe will guide you through the steps to create a deliciously satisfying bowl of Naengmyeon.</p><h2 id=what-is-naengmyeon>What is Naengmyeon?</h2><p>Naengmyeon (냉면) is a traditional Korean cold noodle dish that consists of long, thin noodles served in a chilled, icy broth, often accompanied by a variety of toppings like boiled egg, cucumber, and slices of cold beef or pear. The dish is traditionally enjoyed in the sweltering heat of summer, but it’s delicious year-round.</p><p>The noodles used in Naengmyeon are usually made from a combination of buckwheat flour, sweet potato starch, or sometimes even potatoes, giving them a chewy, slightly elastic texture. The broth, on the other hand, is typically made from beef or chicken stock, seasoned with vinegar and mustard for an added tang.</p><p>In Korea, Naengmyeon is often served in two varieties: <strong>Mul Naengmyeon</strong> (물냉면), which is served with a cold, refreshing broth, and <strong>Bibim Naengmyeon</strong> (비빔냉면), which is a spicier, non-broth version of the dish that’s mixed with a spicy gochujang sauce.</p><p>In this recipe, we’ll be focusing on the <strong>Mul Naengmyeon</strong> style, perfect for cooling off in the summer heat.</p><h2 id=ingredients-for-naengmyeon>Ingredients for Naengmyeon</h2><p>Before diving into the steps, let&rsquo;s gather all the ingredients you’ll need for a delicious bowl of Naengmyeon:</p><h3 id=for-the-noodles>For the Noodles:</h3><ul><li><strong>Naengmyeon noodles</strong>: You can find these at most Korean grocery stores. They are typically made of buckwheat flour, sweet potato starch, or a combination of both. If you&rsquo;re unable to find Naengmyeon noodles, you can substitute with other cold noodles like somen or soba noodles.</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-broth>For the Broth:</h3><ul><li><strong>Beef broth</strong>: The base of the broth is usually made from beef bones or beef brisket. It can also be made with chicken stock if preferred.</li><li><strong>Vinegar</strong>: A key component for the tangy flavor.</li><li><strong>Sugar</strong>: To balance the acidity of the vinegar.</li><li><strong>Mustard paste</strong>: Adds a gentle heat to the broth. You can find this in Asian grocery stores or substitute with a mild Dijon mustard.</li><li><strong>Sesame oil</strong>: A hint of sesame oil adds a toasted, nutty fragrance to the dish.</li></ul><h3 id=for-the-toppings>For the Toppings:</h3><ul><li><strong>Cucumber</strong>: Thinly sliced into matchsticks.</li><li><strong>Boiled egg</strong>: Typically halved for garnish.</li><li><strong>Korean pear (optional)</strong>: Thinly sliced. Korean pears have a crisp texture and mild sweetness that pairs beautifully with the dish.</li><li><strong>Beef</strong>: Thin slices of boiled or grilled beef, such as brisket, can be added for extra flavor.</li><li><strong>Kimchi</strong>: A small serving of kimchi on the side can provide a spicy and tangy contrast.</li><li><strong>Sesame seeds</strong>: A sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds for garnish.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-make-naengmyeon-mul-naengmyeon>How to Make Naengmyeon (Mul Naengmyeon)</h2><p>Making Naengmyeon is a multi-step process, but it’s worth every bit of effort. The refreshing, slightly tangy broth paired with chewy noodles and crisp toppings makes for a delightful summer meal. Follow the steps below to make your own Naengmyeon at home.</p><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-beef-broth>Step 1: Prepare the Beef Broth</h3><p>Start by preparing the beef broth, which will serve as the base of the Naengmyeon. Here’s how you can do it:</p><ol><li><strong>Boil the Beef</strong>: Place about 500 grams (1 lb) of beef brisket or short ribs into a large pot. Add water to cover the beef and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat and simmer for 1.5 to 2 hours, skimming any impurities that rise to the surface.</li><li><strong>Season the Broth</strong>: After the beef has been simmering for a couple of hours, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 1 tablespoon of sugar, and 2 tablespoons of vinegar. Adjust the seasoning to taste, ensuring the broth has a balance of savory, sweet, and tangy flavors.</li><li><strong>Cool the Broth</strong>: Once the broth has finished simmering and is seasoned to your liking, strain out the beef and any vegetables. Allow the broth to cool to room temperature before placing it in the refrigerator to chill for at least an hour or two. The colder, the better!</li></ol><h3 id=step-2-prepare-the-noodles>Step 2: Prepare the Noodles</h3><p>While the broth is chilling, you can prepare the noodles. Depending on the type of noodles you are using, the cooking process may vary slightly. However, most Naengmyeon noodles require the following steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Boil the Noodles</strong>: Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the Naengmyeon noodles and cook according to the package instructions, usually for 3-4 minutes.</li><li><strong>Rinse with Cold Water</strong>: Once the noodles are cooked, drain them in a colander and rinse them under cold water. This step is essential to stop the cooking process and cool the noodles down quickly.</li><li><strong>Prepare the Noodles for Serving</strong>: After rinsing the noodles, you can give them a quick rinse in ice-cold water to ensure they are chilled thoroughly. This will enhance the dish’s refreshing quality.</li></ol><h3 id=step-3-assemble-the-naengmyeon>Step 3: Assemble the Naengmyeon</h3><p>Once your noodles and broth are ready, it’s time to assemble the dish. Here’s how you can do it:</p><ol><li><strong>Place the Noodles in a Bowl</strong>: Take a serving bowl and place the chilled noodles inside. Use chopsticks or tongs to spread them evenly in the bowl, creating a nest-like shape.</li><li><strong>Add the Chilled Broth</strong>: Pour the chilled beef broth over the noodles. The broth should cover the noodles entirely, creating a refreshing soup base.</li><li><strong>Add Toppings</strong>: Arrange your toppings neatly over the noodles. Place thinly sliced cucumber, a boiled egg half, a few slices of Korean pear (optional), and a few slices of beef on top. You can also add a small spoonful of kimchi on the side for a spicy contrast.</li><li><strong>Garnish</strong>: Sprinkle a small handful of toasted sesame seeds over the top for an extra crunch and aroma.</li></ol><h3 id=step-4-serve-and-enjoy>Step 4: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Serve your Naengmyeon immediately while the broth is still cold and the noodles are chilled. For added flavor, you can also offer a small dish of mustard paste on the side, which can be added to the broth for a bit of heat. Pair your Naengmyeon with a refreshing glass of iced tea or a light Korean drink like <em>sikhye</em> (sweet rice drink) for a true Korean summer experience.</p><h2 id=tips-and-variations-for-naengmyeon>Tips and Variations for Naengmyeon</h2><p>While this recipe follows the traditional style of Naengmyeon, there are a few ways you can customize it to your preferences:</p><h3 id=1-spicy-naengmyeon>1. <strong>Spicy Naengmyeon</strong>:</h3><p>If you enjoy a bit of spice, you can turn your Mul Naengmyeon into <strong>Bibim Naengmyeon</strong> by adding gochujang (Korean red chili paste) to the broth or mixing it directly into the noodles. This will give the dish a bold, fiery flavor that contrasts nicely with the coolness of the noodles and broth.</p><h3 id=2-vegetarian-option>2. <strong>Vegetarian Option</strong>:</h3><p>For a vegetarian version, substitute the beef broth with a vegetable broth made from mushrooms, onions, and garlic. Tofu can be added as a protein alternative to the beef, and you can load up the toppings with a variety of vegetables such as radish, spinach, or bell peppers.</p><h3 id=3-adding-ice>3. <strong>Adding Ice</strong>:</h3><p>In some Korean restaurants, Naengmyeon is served with ice cubes in the broth to make it even colder and more refreshing. If you want that icy experience, feel free to add a few cubes of ice to the broth.</p><h2 id=why-naengmyeon-is-the-perfect-summer-dish>Why Naengmyeon is the Perfect Summer Dish</h2><p>There are many reasons why Naengmyeon is a beloved summer dish in Korea. First, it’s incredibly refreshing and helps cool down the body in hot weather. The chilled broth and cold noodles are the perfect antidote to a scorching summer day.
