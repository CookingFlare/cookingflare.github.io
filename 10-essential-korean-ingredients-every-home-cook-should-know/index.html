These flakes are typically milder than the chili paste and provide a distinct heat and smokiness to Korean dishes.</p><p>Gochugaru is the key ingredient in making <strong>kimchi</strong>, Korea’s famous fermented vegetable dish, and it’s also used in a variety of other dishes such as <strong>kimchi jjigae</strong> (kimchi stew) and <strong>banchan</strong> (side dishes). The flakes come in different grind sizes, ranging from fine to coarse, allowing you to adjust the heat and texture of your dishes.</p><h3 id=how-to-use-gochugaru>How to Use Gochugaru:</h3><ul><li>Sprinkle it over <strong>kimchi</strong> or use it as a seasoning for homemade kimchi.</li><li>Stir it into soups, stews, and sauces for an extra kick.</li><li>Add it to your favorite stir-fries for flavor and heat.</li></ul><h2 id=3-doenjang-fermented-soybean-paste>3. Doenjang (Fermented Soybean Paste)</h2><p>Doenjang is a fermented soybean paste that plays a similar role to miso in Japanese cuisine. However, it has a more robust, earthy flavor. The paste is made by fermenting soybeans and wheat, and the result is a thick, savory, umami-packed ingredient that is essential in many Korean dishes.</p><p>It’s used in <strong>doenjang jjigae</strong> (fermented soybean paste stew), a hearty and comforting dish that often includes vegetables, tofu, and sometimes pork or beef. Doenjang is also used in marinades, dipping sauces, and even as a condiment to pair with rice.</p><h3 id=how-to-use-doenjang>How to Use Doenjang:</h3><ul><li>Use it to make <strong>doenjang jjigae</strong> for a comforting and rich stew.</li><li>Mix it with gochugaru and sesame oil to make a dipping sauce for grilled meats.</li><li>Add a spoonful to soups and stews for added depth of flavor.</li></ul><h2 id=4-sesame-oil>4.
