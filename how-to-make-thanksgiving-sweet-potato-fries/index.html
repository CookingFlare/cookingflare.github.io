Their natural sweetness and crispy texture make them a crowd favorite, especially when paired with turkey, stuffing, and other savory dishes. The best part is that sweet potatoes are incredibly versatile and can be seasoned in many ways, ensuring there’s a flavor for everyone at the dinner table.</p><p>In this post, we’ll show you how to make the perfect Thanksgiving sweet potato fries that are crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and full of flavor. From selecting the right sweet potatoes to seasoning and cooking them to perfection, you’ll learn all the tips and tricks to create this delightful side dish.</p><h2 id=why-sweet-potato-fries-for-thanksgiving>Why Sweet Potato Fries for Thanksgiving?</h2><p>Thanksgiving is a time for family, tradition, and delicious food. While mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables are common on the dinner table, sweet potato fries offer something a little different. They add a burst of color and a touch of sweetness, balancing the richness of other holiday dishes. They are also a healthier alternative to regular fries, offering vitamins, fiber, and antioxidants.</p><p>Sweet potato fries are perfect for anyone looking to add a modern twist to traditional Thanksgiving fare. Plus, they’re incredibly easy to make and don’t require much prep work. Whether you’re preparing a large feast or just a small gathering, sweet potato fries can be the perfect accompaniment to your meal.</p><h2 id=selecting-the-best-sweet-potatoes>Selecting the Best Sweet Potatoes</h2><p>The foundation of a great batch of sweet potato fries lies in selecting the right sweet potatoes. While most sweet potatoes will work, there are a few things to consider when choosing the best ones for fries.</p><h3 id=look-for-firm-sweet-potatoes>Look for Firm Sweet Potatoes</h3><p>Select sweet potatoes that are firm to the touch. Avoid ones that are soft, shriveled, or have any visible blemishes or dark spots. Firm sweet potatoes will hold up better when cut into fries and will cook more evenly.</p><h3 id=choose-the-right-size>Choose the Right Size</h3><p>For fries, medium-sized sweet potatoes work best. They’re easier to cut into uniform pieces and cook more evenly than larger sweet potatoes. Small sweet potatoes can also be used, but they may require more careful slicing to get the ideal fry shape.</p><h3 id=organic-vs-conventional>Organic vs. Conventional</h3><p>While both organic and conventional sweet potatoes will work, organic sweet potatoes are often preferred for their better taste and higher nutrient content. If possible, opt for organic sweet potatoes to ensure your fries are as fresh and flavorful as possible.</p><h2 id=preparing-the-sweet-potatoes>Preparing the Sweet Potatoes</h2><p>Before you begin making your sweet potato fries, proper preparation is key to ensuring they cook evenly and have the perfect texture.</p><h3 id=washing-and-peeling>Washing and Peeling</h3><p>Start by thoroughly washing the sweet potatoes to remove any dirt or residue. Use a vegetable brush to scrub the skin, especially if you&rsquo;re using conventionally grown sweet potatoes.</p><p>Next, peel the sweet potatoes using a vegetable peeler. You can leave the skin on if you prefer a more rustic, hearty fry, but for a smoother texture, it’s best to peel them.</p><h3 id=cutting-the-sweet-potatoes>Cutting the Sweet Potatoes</h3><p>Once peeled, it’s time to cut the sweet potatoes into fries. Aim for fries that are about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. If the fries are too thin, they may burn before they become crispy, and if they’re too thick, they may not cook all the way through.</p><p>For consistency, it’s best to cut the fries into rectangular shapes. You can also try cutting them into wedges if you prefer thicker, chunkier fries.</p><h2 id=seasoning-the-sweet-potato-fries>Seasoning the Sweet Potato Fries</h2><p>The beauty of sweet potato fries is their versatility in seasoning. You can use a variety of spices and herbs to customize the flavor, from savory to sweet. Here are some delicious seasoning options to enhance the natural flavor of the sweet potatoes.</p><h3 id=savory-seasonings>Savory Seasonings</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Garlic and Rosemary</strong>: A classic combination, garlic and rosemary bring a savory depth to sweet potato fries. Minced garlic and finely chopped rosemary make the perfect seasoning for a fragrant, herbal flavor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cajun Seasoning</strong>: For a spicier twist, Cajun seasoning is an excellent choice. The blend of paprika, cayenne, and other spices adds a bit of heat and a lot of flavor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Smoked Paprika and Thyme</strong>: Smoked paprika provides a smoky flavor, which complements the sweetness of the potatoes. Add a touch of thyme for an earthy, aromatic touch.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chili Powder and Lime</strong>: If you like a bit of tang, chili powder and a squeeze of fresh lime juice create a zesty, bold flavor that contrasts beautifully with the sweet potatoes.</p></li></ol><h3 id=sweet-seasonings>Sweet Seasonings</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Cinnamon and Brown Sugar</strong>: For those who love sweet potato fries with a touch of sweetness, cinnamon and brown sugar are a great choice. This combination gives the fries a warm, comforting flavor, perfect for the holiday season.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maple Syrup and Cinnamon</strong>: Drizzling a bit of maple syrup over your fries and sprinkling cinnamon will give them a lovely sweetness that is perfect for Thanksgiving.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pumpkin Spice</strong>: For a truly festive flavor, add pumpkin spice to your fries. This spice blend brings together cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves, providing a fragrant, seasonal flavor that’s perfect for the holiday table.</p></li></ol><h3 id=olive-oil-or-butter>Olive Oil or Butter?</h3><p>When it comes to coating your sweet potato fries, you’ll need a fat to help the seasoning stick and to ensure they cook properly. Olive oil is a great option because it has a high smoke point and adds a slight fruity flavor. Alternatively, you can use melted butter for a richer, more decadent taste.</p><p>Toss the cut fries in your chosen fat, ensuring they are evenly coated. This step is essential for achieving a crispy exterior while keeping the interior tender.</p><h2 id=cooking-sweet-potato-fries>Cooking Sweet Potato Fries</h2><p>There are two main methods for cooking sweet potato fries: baking and frying. Both methods yield delicious results, but each has its pros and cons.</p><h3 id=baking-sweet-potato-fries>Baking Sweet Potato Fries</h3><p>Baking is the healthier and easier option, as it requires little to no oil and can be done in a single pan. Here’s how to bake the perfect sweet potato fries:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Preheat the Oven</strong>: Set your oven to 425°F (220°C). This high temperature helps to crisp up the fries without drying them out.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prepare a Baking Sheet</strong>: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spread the Fries</strong>: Arrange the seasoned sweet potato fries in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Avoid overcrowding the fries, as this can cause them to steam instead of crisp up.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bake the Fries</strong>: Bake the fries for 25-30 minutes, flipping them halfway through to ensure even cooking. Keep an eye on them to prevent burning. The fries are done when they are golden brown and crispy on the edges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Serve and Enjoy</strong>: Once they’re done, remove the fries from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes before serving. Pair them with your favorite dipping sauce for an extra touch of flavor.</p></li></ol><h3 id=frying-sweet-potato-fries>Frying Sweet Potato Fries</h3><p>Frying results in crispy, golden fries, but it requires more oil and attention. If you prefer to fry your sweet potato fries, follow these steps:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Heat the Oil</strong>: In a large pot or deep fryer, heat enough vegetable oil to submerge the fries to 375°F (190°C). Use a thermometer to ensure the oil reaches the correct temperature.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fry the Fries</strong>: Fry the sweet potato fries in batches, avoiding overcrowding the pot. Cook for about 3-4 minutes per batch or until golden brown and crispy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drain and Season</strong>: Once the fries are cooked, transfer them to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Season immediately with salt or your favorite seasoning blend.</p></li><li><p><strong>Serve and Enjoy</strong>: Serve your fried sweet potato fries hot with dipping sauces of your choice.</p></li></ol><h2 id=dipping-sauces-for-sweet-potato-fries>Dipping Sauces for Sweet Potato Fries</h2><p>The right dipping sauce can elevate your sweet potato fries to the next level. Here are some tasty dipping sauces to serve alongside your fries:</p><h3 id=1-garlic-aioli>1. <strong>Garlic Aioli</strong></h3><p>A creamy, garlic-infused aioli is a perfect match for the sweetness of the fries. The rich, savory flavor of the aioli complements the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes.</p><h3 id=2-sriracha-mayo>2. <strong>Sriracha Mayo</strong></h3><p>For those who like a bit of heat, a mixture of mayonnaise and sriracha sauce is a spicy and creamy dipping option.</p><h3 id=3-honey-mustard>3. <strong>Honey Mustard</strong></h3><p>The tangy and sweet flavor of honey mustard pairs wonderfully with sweet potato fries. The balance of sweet and sour is a great complement to the fries&rsquo; flavor.</p><h3 id=4-balsamic-vinegar-dip>4. <strong>Balsamic Vinegar Dip</strong></h3><p>A balsamic vinegar-based dipping sauce adds a tart, slightly sweet flavor that contrasts nicely with the fries’ sweetness.</p><h3 id=5-ranch-dressing>5. <strong>Ranch Dressing</strong></h3><p>Classic ranch dressing is another great dipping option. Its creamy and tangy flavor pairs well with the crispy texture of the fries.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Making Thanksgiving sweet potato fries is a simple yet flavorful way to add variety to your holiday meal. Whether you bake or fry them, the sweet potatoes&rsquo; natural sweetness and crispy texture will make them a hit at your Thanksgiving dinner. Experiment with different seasonings to find your favorite flavor profile and serve them alongside your turkey, stuffing, and other festive dishes.
