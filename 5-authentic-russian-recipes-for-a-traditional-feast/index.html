Divide the dough into small pieces, about the size of a small egg.
Roll each piece into a thin circle.
Place a tablespoon of the meat mixture in the center of each circle.
Fold the dough over the filling to form a half-circle or a triangle shape. Seal the edges by pinching them together.
Heat some vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Fry the pelmeni until golden brown on both sides.
Serve the pelmeni hot with a side of sour cream, chopped fresh dill, and a sprinkle of black pepper.</p><p>Recipe 2: Belegianskye (Russian Beef Stroganoff)
