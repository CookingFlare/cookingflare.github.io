Whether you&rsquo;re grilling for just a few people or a big crowd, it’s a no-fuss way to add something special to your meal.</p><h2 id=ingredients-youll-need>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2><p>Making grilled corn on the cob requires just a handful of ingredients, making it both simple and accessible. Here’s what you’ll need:</p><ul><li>Fresh corn on the cob (as many as you need for your BBQ)</li><li>Butter (unsalted or salted, depending on your preference)</li><li>Olive oil (optional, for added crispiness)</li><li>Salt (kosher or sea salt is ideal)</li><li>Black pepper (freshly ground)</li><li>Fresh herbs (optional; cilantro, parsley, or basil work well)</li><li>Lime wedges (optional, for a zesty kick)</li><li>Parmesan cheese (optional, for a savory topping)</li><li>Chili powder or smoked paprika (optional, for a little heat)</li></ul><p>While these ingredients are basic, you can get creative with your seasonings and toppings. Corn is the perfect blank canvas for a variety of flavor profiles, so feel free to experiment with your favorite spices and herbs.</p><h2 id=step-by-step-instructions-for-grilled-corn-on-the-cob>Step-by-Step Instructions for Grilled Corn on the Cob</h2><h3 id=step-1-prepping-the-corn>Step 1: Prepping the Corn</h3><p>Before you can grill the corn, you need to prep it. You can either leave the husks on or remove them entirely, depending on how you like your grilled corn.</p><p><strong>Option 1: Grilling Corn in the Husk</strong><br>Grilling corn in the husk helps retain moisture, resulting in juicy and tender kernels. Plus, it adds a lovely smokiness as the husks char. To prepare the corn this way, follow these steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Peel back the outer layers of the husk</strong> to expose the corn, but don’t remove them entirely. You want to leave the husk attached at the base, as this will help trap the heat while grilling.</li><li><strong>Remove the silk</strong> from each ear of corn. This is the stringy stuff inside that can be a little difficult to get rid of, but it’s important to remove as much as possible.</li><li><strong>Fold the husks back around the corn</strong>, covering it as much as possible, and tie the end with a piece of kitchen twine or simply fold it under.</li></ol><p><strong>Option 2: Grilling Corn Without the Husk</strong><br>If you prefer a more direct char on your corn, you can grill it without the husk. This method results in more pronounced grill marks and a slightly crispier texture. To prepare the corn this way:</p><ol><li><strong>Peel off the husks entirely</strong>, including the silk.</li><li><strong>Trim the ends</strong> of the corn if necessary, especially if they have any rough or uneven edges.</li></ol><h3 id=step-2-preheat-the-grill>Step 2: Preheat the Grill</h3><p>Once the corn is prepped, it’s time to get the grill going. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. You want the temperature to be hot enough to create a nice sear on the corn without burning it. If you’re using a charcoal grill, allow the coals to burn down to a steady heat. For a gas grill, simply turn it on and give it a few minutes to come up to temperature.</p><h3 id=step-3-grill-the-corn>Step 3: Grill the Corn</h3><p>Now comes the fun part! Place the corn on the grill and allow it to cook, turning it occasionally to ensure even grilling.</p><ul><li><p><strong>For corn with the husk</strong>: Place the corn directly on the grill. Cook for 15-20 minutes, turning it every 5 minutes to ensure all sides are charred and cooked through. You’ll know it’s done when the husks are nicely blackened and the corn kernels are tender when pierced with a fork.</p></li><li><p><strong>For corn without the husk</strong>: Place the naked corn directly on the grill. You’ll want to rotate the corn every 2-3 minutes, keeping a close eye on it to ensure it doesn’t burn. Grill for 10-15 minutes, until the kernels are charred and tender.</p></li></ul><p>While grilling, you can also <strong>brush the corn with olive oil</strong> or <strong>butter</strong> to add a little extra flavor and crispness. Some people like to do this at the very end of the grilling process to avoid burning the butter.</p><h3 id=step-4-adding-flavor-with-toppings>Step 4: Adding Flavor with Toppings</h3><p>Once the corn is perfectly grilled, it’s time to add some finishing touches. This is where you can get creative and personalize your corn to suit your taste.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Butter and Salt</strong>: The classic option is to slather the corn with butter (unsalted or salted, depending on your preference) and sprinkle it generously with sea salt. This simple combination highlights the sweetness of the corn and the smokiness from the grill.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cheese and Spices</strong>: For a more savory option, try sprinkling the grilled corn with freshly grated Parmesan or Cotija cheese, along with a dash of chili powder or smoked paprika for a little heat. This option adds both flavor and texture that will leave your guests asking for seconds.</p></li><li><p><strong>Herbs and Lime</strong>: If you prefer a lighter, fresher take on grilled corn, top it with fresh chopped herbs like cilantro or parsley. A squeeze of fresh lime juice adds a tangy kick that contrasts beautifully with the sweetness of the corn.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spicy Kick</strong>: For those who like it hot, you can drizzle the corn with a little sriracha sauce, or sprinkle on some cayenne pepper, or even top with crumbled chili flakes. Adding a little heat balances the sweetness of the corn and gives it an exciting twist.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make It Elote-Style</strong>: Elote is a popular Mexican street food that takes corn on the cob to a whole new level. To make elote-style corn, simply spread a thin layer of mayo or sour cream on the cooked corn and sprinkle with crumbled cheese, chili powder, and cilantro. A squeeze of lime completes the dish.</p></li></ol><h3 id=step-5-serve-and-enjoy>Step 5: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Once your corn is grilled and dressed with all the toppings, it’s time to serve. Corn on the cob is best served hot off the grill, so make sure to bring it directly to the table or serve it alongside your main BBQ dishes. Provide napkins and extra lime wedges for guests to enjoy, and watch as they dig into this delicious side dish.</p><h2 id=tips-for-the-perfect-grilled-corn>Tips for the Perfect Grilled Corn</h2><ul><li><strong>Soak the corn (optional)</strong>: Some people like to soak the corn in water for about 10-15 minutes before grilling it in the husk. This can help retain moisture and prevent the husks from burning too quickly, although it&rsquo;s not strictly necessary.</li><li><strong>Watch the heat</strong>: Too much heat can burn the corn, while too little will leave it undercooked. Aim for medium-high heat and turn the corn regularly to avoid any uneven cooking.</li><li><strong>Experiment with flavors</strong>: Corn is incredibly versatile, so feel free to try different seasoning combinations. You can even make flavored butters, like garlic herb butter or smoked paprika butter, to brush on the corn while it’s grilling.</li><li><strong>Check for doneness</strong>: If you’re unsure if your corn is done, simply pierce a kernel with a fork. If the corn is tender and the juices run clear, it’s ready.</li></ul><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Grilled corn on the cob is one of those dishes that never fails to impress at a 4th of July BBQ. Whether you grill it with the husk on or off, and whether you top it with butter, cheese, herbs, or spices, it’s sure to be a hit at your next summer gathering. With just a few simple ingredients and some careful grilling, you can elevate your BBQ experience and create a dish that’s both flavorful and memorable. So fire up the grill, grab some fresh corn, and get ready to enjoy a classic American summer treat.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/categories/fourth-of-july-bbqs/>Fourth of July Bbqs</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/how-to-make-grilled-beef-skewers-for-your-fourth-of-july-party/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>How to Make Grilled Beef Skewers for Your Fourth of July Party</span>
