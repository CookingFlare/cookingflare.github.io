Whether you have a bountiful harvest from your garden or want to take advantage of seasonal sales at the grocery store, learning how to can corn is a rewarding and practical skill. The process is relatively simple and can be done with the right tools and a bit of patience. Canning corn will allow you to enjoy its fresh, sweet flavor long after the season ends. In this guide, we will walk you through the step-by-step process of canning corn, from selecting the right type of corn to storing your jars for optimal shelf life.</p><h2 id=why-can-corn>Why Can Corn?</h2><p>Canning is a time-tested method of preserving food, and corn is one of the best candidates for this technique. Fresh corn on the cob is delicious and versatile, but its shelf life is limited to just a few days after picking. By canning corn, you can enjoy its flavor and nutritional value throughout the year, even during the winter months when fresh corn is hard to come by. Canned corn is also perfect for soups, stews, casseroles, salads, and many other dishes, making it a staple in any home pantry.</p><h2 id=types-of-corn-to-can>Types of Corn to Can</h2><p>When it comes to canning corn, not all varieties are created equal. The best corn for canning is typically sweet corn, as it has the tender kernels and natural sweetness that makes it so popular. There are two main types of sweet corn: <em>su</em> corn and <em>se</em> corn.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Su Corn</strong>: This is the most common type of sweet corn grown for canning. It has a soft, tender kernel and a high sugar content, which makes it ideal for preserving.</p></li><li><p><strong>Se Corn</strong>: This variety is known for its sweetness and tenderness, but it has a slightly different texture compared to <em>su</em> corn. It can also be canned, though it may require a slightly different processing time.</p></li></ul><p>You’ll also want to select ears of corn that are fresh, with tightly packed, plump kernels. The cob should feel firm to the touch, and the husk should be green and unblemished. Avoid using overripe corn, as it may result in tough kernels or an inferior texture after canning.</p><h2 id=preparing-your-corn-for-canning>Preparing Your Corn for Canning</h2><p>Before you start canning corn, it’s important to prepare the corn properly. This includes husking the corn, removing the kernels, and blanching the corn. Here’s a detailed breakdown of each step:</p><h3 id=1-husk-and-clean-the-corn>1. <strong>Husk and Clean the Corn</strong></h3><p>Begin by removing the husks and silk from the ears of corn. Be thorough in cleaning the corn, as any remaining silk or husk can affect the final product. It’s essential that the corn is completely clean before proceeding to the next steps.</p><h3 id=2-cutting-the-kernels-off-the-cob>2. <strong>Cutting the Kernels Off the Cob</strong></h3><p>Once the corn is cleaned, the next step is to remove the kernels from the cob. There are two main methods for doing this:</p><ul><li><strong>Using a knife</strong>: Hold the cob firmly at both ends and cut downwards with a sharp knife, removing the kernels in strips.</li><li><strong>Using a corn kernel remover tool</strong>: This specialized tool can help remove the kernels more efficiently and with less mess.</li></ul><p>It’s important to cut the kernels as close to the cob as possible but be careful not to scrape the cob itself, as this can result in a bitter flavor. Depending on how you plan to use the corn later, you may want to cut the kernels into smaller pieces or leave them whole.</p><h3 id=3-blanch-the-corn>3. <strong>Blanch the Corn</strong></h3><p>Blanching corn is a critical step in the canning process as it stops the enzymatic action that could otherwise degrade the flavor and texture of the corn. To blanch corn, you’ll need to bring a large pot of water to a boil.</p><ul><li><strong>Boil the water</strong>: Fill a large pot with enough water to submerge the corn and bring it to a rolling boil.</li><li><strong>Blanch the kernels</strong>: Once the water is boiling, drop the corn kernels into the pot. Let them cook for 4 to 6 minutes. If you are canning whole kernels, be sure to blanch them for the full 6 minutes to ensure they are adequately cooked.</li><li><strong>Ice bath</strong>: After blanching, immediately transfer the corn to an ice water bath to stop the cooking process. Let it sit for a few minutes until the kernels are completely cooled.</li></ul><h3 id=4-drain-the-corn>4. <strong>Drain the Corn</strong></h3><p>After the corn has been blanched and cooled, drain it thoroughly. You can use a fine-mesh strainer or colander for this step. Ensuring that there’s no excess water left in the corn will help maintain the quality of the canned product.</p><h2 id=canning-supplies-youll-need>Canning Supplies You’ll Need</h2><p>To can corn successfully, you’ll need some basic canning supplies. Here’s a list of the essential equipment:</p><ul><li><strong>Canning jars</strong>: Choose jars that are specifically designed for canning. Wide-mouth jars are often preferred for corn because they make it easier to pack the kernels tightly.</li><li><strong>Lids and rings</strong>: Ensure you have fresh, new lids for sealing the jars. Used lids may not seal properly, which could result in spoilage. The rings are used to secure the lid in place during the canning process.</li><li><strong>Canning pot</strong>: A large pot for boiling the jars and water during the canning process.</li><li><strong>Jar lifter</strong>: This tool helps you safely lift hot jars in and out of the boiling water without burning yourself.</li><li><strong>Canning funnel</strong>: A funnel helps ensure that the corn is poured into the jars without making a mess.</li><li><strong>Bubble remover tool</strong>: This tool helps remove any trapped air bubbles from the jar after it has been filled with corn.</li></ul><h2 id=packing-the-corn-into-jars>Packing the Corn into Jars</h2><p>Once your corn is prepared and your equipment is ready, you can start packing the corn into the jars. Here&rsquo;s how to do it:</p><h3 id=1-sterilize-your-jars>1. <strong>Sterilize Your Jars</strong></h3><p>Before you begin packing the corn into the jars, it’s essential to sterilize them. You can sterilize jars by placing them in a canner or large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes. This step ensures that no bacteria or contaminants are present to spoil your corn.</p><h3 id=2-pack-the-jars>2. <strong>Pack the Jars</strong></h3><p>Using a canning funnel, fill the sterilized jars with the prepared corn. Pack the corn tightly but without crushing it. The kernels should be snug, but there should be about 1 inch of headspace at the top of the jar. Headspace is important for allowing the food to expand during the canning process and ensures a proper seal.</p><h3 id=3-add-salt-optional>3. <strong>Add Salt (Optional)</strong></h3><p>While salt is optional when canning corn, adding a small amount can enhance the flavor of the final product. A general guideline is to add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt per pint jar or 1 teaspoon per quart jar. You can also opt for no salt if you prefer a low-sodium version.</p><h3 id=4-wipe-the-rims>4. <strong>Wipe the Rims</strong></h3><p>After packing the jars, it’s crucial to wipe the rims of each jar with a clean, damp cloth. This ensures that the lids will seal properly.</p><h2 id=processing-the-jars>Processing the Jars</h2><p>Once your jars are packed and ready, it’s time to process them in a pressure canner. Corn, being a low-acid food, requires the higher temperature that a pressure canner provides. A water bath canner will not reach the necessary temperatures to safely preserve corn.</p><h3 id=1-prepare-the-pressure-canner>1. <strong>Prepare the Pressure Canner</strong></h3><p>Fill the bottom of the pressure canner with water according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Place the jars into the canner, ensuring that they are not touching each other and are not overcrowded.</p><h3 id=2-process-the-jars>2. <strong>Process the Jars</strong></h3><p>Close the lid on the pressure canner and bring it to the required pressure (usually 10-15 pounds of pressure). Process pint jars for 55 minutes and quart jars for 85 minutes at the correct pressure.</p><h3 id=3-allow-the-pressure-canner-to-cool>3. <strong>Allow the Pressure Canner to Cool</strong></h3><p>After the processing time is complete, turn off the heat and allow the canner to cool down naturally. Do not force the lid open, as this can cause the jars to break. Once the pressure has been released and the canner is cool to the touch, carefully remove the jars using a jar lifter.</p><h2 id=storing-the-canned-corn>Storing the Canned Corn</h2><p>Once your jars have cooled and the lids have sealed, you can store them in a cool, dark, and dry place. The pantry or a cupboard away from direct sunlight works best. Check the seals of your jars by pressing down on the center of the lid; if it doesn’t pop back, the jar is properly sealed. Properly canned corn can last up to a year, though for the best taste, it’s recommended to use it within 6-12 months.</p><h2 id=tips-for-canning-corn>Tips for Canning Corn</h2><ul><li><strong>Use Fresh Corn</strong>: The fresher the corn, the better the flavor after canning. Try to can corn on the day it’s harvested or purchased for the best quality.</li><li><strong>Pack the Jars Tightly</strong>: Corn shrinks slightly during processing, so packing the jars tightly ensures that you get a good amount of corn in each jar.</li><li><strong>Don’t Skip Blanching</strong>: Blanching is essential for preserving the texture and flavor of the corn. It also helps to kill any bacteria or pests that may be on the kernels.</li><li><strong>Check the Seals</strong>: After the jars have cooled, check the seals to ensure that they are tight. If any jars haven’t sealed properly, you can either refrigerate them and use them immediately or reprocess them with a new lid.</li></ul><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Canning corn is a wonderful way to preserve the taste of summer and enjoy fresh corn year-round. By following these steps carefully and ensuring that you use the right equipment and techniques, you can create delicious canned corn that will last for months. Whether you’re using it in soups, salads, casseroles, or as a side dish, canned corn is a versatile ingredient that adds sweetness and flavor to any meal. With a little bit of practice, you’ll soon be an expert at canning corn and be able to stock your pantry with this tasty, seasonal treat. Happy canning!</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/categories/preserving-and-canning/>Preserving and Canning</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://cooking.googlexy.com/canning-beyond-jellies-savory-onion-marmalades/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Canning Beyond Jellies: Savory Onion Marmalades</span>
