From the sizzling grills to the mouthwatering aromas that fill the air, the streets of cities like Beirut, Istanbul, Cairo, and Dubai are a true celebration of food. Among the most iconic and beloved dishes is shawarma, a savory meat-based treat that’s become a global favorite. However, the Middle Eastern street food scene is far more diverse than just shawarma, with countless other dishes that showcase the rich flavors and traditions of the region. In this guide, we will take you through the most popular street foods of the Middle East, from shawarma to falafel, kebabs, and beyond.</p><h2 id=what-is-shawarma>What is Shawarma?</h2><p>Shawarma is perhaps the most famous Middle Eastern street food worldwide. Originating from the Levant region, specifically Lebanon, shawarma consists of marinated meat (often lamb, chicken, or beef) that is slow-cooked on a vertical rotisserie. The process involves stacking layers of thinly sliced meat, which are then gradually cooked by heat from the side. This method not only ensures the meat remains juicy but also gives it a signature crispy outer layer, adding texture and flavor.</p><p>Traditionally, shawarma is served in pita bread or laffa (a type of flatbread), accompanied by a variety of condiments such as tahini, garlic sauce, pickles, and vegetables. It’s a complete meal in a handheld form, making it the ideal street food.</p><h3 id=shawarma-marinade>Shawarma Marinade</h3><p>To achieve the perfect shawarma, the key is in the marinade. The meat is typically marinated for several hours or overnight to allow the flavors to fully develop. Some common ingredients used in shawarma marinades include:</p><ul><li>Yogurt</li><li>Lemon juice</li><li>Olive oil</li><li>Garlic</li><li>Cumin</li><li>Paprika</li><li>Cinnamon</li><li>Cardamom</li><li>Cloves</li></ul><p>The combination of these spices gives shawarma its aromatic, warm flavor profile. The yogurt helps tenderize the meat while also providing a subtle tang.</p><h2 id=the-evolution-of-shawarma>The Evolution of Shawarma</h2><p>While shawarma is a street food staple in countries like Lebanon, Turkey, Syria, and Jordan, it has evolved over time and become a beloved dish worldwide. In fact, its influence can be seen in many cultures, with variations such as the Turkish döner kebab, the Greek gyro, and the Israeli shawarma. While these dishes have similar preparation methods, the flavoring, sauces, and garnishes may vary slightly based on the region.</p><p>In the Middle East, shawarma has become so ingrained in daily life that it’s often eaten as a late-night snack after a long day of work or partying. It’s also a popular choice for gatherings and casual celebrations, adding to its status as a beloved national dish in many countries.</p><h2 id=other-middle-eastern-street-foods-to-try>Other Middle Eastern Street Foods to Try</h2><p>While shawarma often steals the spotlight, there are plenty of other delicious Middle Eastern street foods that deserve your attention. Let’s dive into some other beloved dishes you can find on the streets of the Middle East.</p><h3 id=1-falafel>1. Falafel</h3><p>Falafel is a classic vegetarian dish that’s popular across the Middle East, particularly in countries like Lebanon, Egypt, and Palestine.

Kebab</h3><p>Kebab is another iconic street food in the Middle East. While it’s often associated with grilled meat, kebab can come in many forms depending on the country and region. The meat is typically marinated in a mixture of olive oil, lemon juice, and a variety of spices before being skewered and grilled over an open flame.</p><p>Some popular types of kebabs include:</p><ul><li><strong>Shish Kebab:</strong> Skewered chunks of marinated meat, often lamb or chicken, grilled until perfectly charred.</li><li><strong>Kofta Kebab:</strong> Ground meat (usually beef or lamb) mixed with herbs and spices, formed into sausages, and grilled on skewers.</li><li><strong>Adana Kebab:</strong> Originating from Turkey, this kebab features minced lamb mixed with peppers and spices, cooked on a flat skewer.</li></ul><p>Kebabs are usually served with flatbread, rice, or salad, and are often complemented with fresh dips like hummus or garlic sauce.</p><h3 id=3-manakish>3.

Sfiha</h3><p>Sfiha, sometimes referred to as “Arabic pizza,” is a savory pastry that originated in the Levant region. The dough is topped with a mixture of ground meat, onions, tomatoes, and spices, then baked until crispy. While it’s similar to a pizza, sfiha is typically smaller and more compact, making it the perfect street food snack.</p><p>Sfiha can be made with a variety of meats, including beef, lamb, or chicken, and is often served with a squeeze of fresh lemon or a dollop of yogurt.</p><h3 id=5-fattoush>5.

The salad is dressed in a tangy mixture of olive oil, lemon juice, and sumac, which gives it a bright, zesty flavor.</p><p>Fattoush is often served as part of a mezze platter or as a side dish to grilled meats and kebabs. It’s a refreshing and healthy option that balances the rich, savory flavors of the other street foods.</p><h3 id=6-bourek>6. Bourek</h3><p>Bourek is a savory pastry filled with a variety of ingredients, such as cheese, spinach, or ground meat. It’s commonly found in countries like Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey, where it’s served as a snack or appetizer. The pastry is usually made with phyllo dough or a similar thin, flaky dough, which crisps up beautifully when fried or baked.</p><p>Bourek can be served hot or cold, and it’s often accompanied by yogurt or a side salad.

Hummus and Pita</h3><p>No guide to Middle Eastern street food would be complete without mentioning hummus, the famous chickpea dip that’s become a global sensation. Hummus is made by blending cooked chickpeas with tahini, lemon juice, garlic, and olive oil until smooth. It’s typically served with warm pita bread and garnished with olive oil, paprika, and fresh herbs.</p><p>Hummus is often eaten as a starter or part of a mezze platter, where it’s paired with other dips and appetizers.

The combination of crunchy fries and tender, flavorful shawarma meat is simply irresistible.</p><h3 id=10-arabic-ice-cream-booza>10.
