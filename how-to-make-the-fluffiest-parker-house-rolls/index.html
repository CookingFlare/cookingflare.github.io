Their name comes from the famous Parker House Hotel in Boston, where they were first created in the 19th century. These rolls are often served at holiday dinners, special gatherings, or as a side to accompany hearty meals. But what makes Parker House Rolls so special? It&rsquo;s all about the texture — soft, tender, and melt-in-your-mouth delicious.</p><p>In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the process of making the fluffiest, most irresistible Parker House Rolls at home. Whether you’re an experienced baker or a novice, you’ll find that making these rolls is easier than you might think. By following the tips and techniques outlined here, you can enjoy warm, freshly baked rolls straight from your oven.</p><h2 id=ingredients-youll-need>Ingredients You&rsquo;ll Need</h2><p>To make the fluffiest Parker House Rolls, you&rsquo;ll need a few essential ingredients. Gather the following before you begin:</p><ul><li><strong>All-purpose flour</strong>: This is the base of the dough. It provides structure and helps create that signature fluffiness.</li><li><strong>Granulated sugar</strong>: A small amount of sugar is needed for flavor, and it helps to activate the yeast.</li><li><strong>Active dry yeast</strong>: This will give your rolls the perfect rise. Make sure your yeast is fresh for the best results.</li><li><strong>Whole milk</strong>: Whole milk is used for its richness, which adds flavor and moisture to the dough.</li><li><strong>Butter</strong>: Butter not only adds flavor but also creates a tender crumb in the rolls.</li><li><strong>Egg</strong>: One egg will help bind the dough together and give the rolls a soft, golden color.</li><li><strong>Salt</strong>: Salt balances out the sweetness of the dough and enhances the overall flavor.</li><li><strong>Water</strong>: You&rsquo;ll need warm water to activate the yeast and hydrate the flour.</li></ul><p>Once you’ve gathered these ingredients, you’re ready to get started.</p><h2 id=step-by-step-instructions>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2><h3 id=1-proof-the-yeast>1. Proof the Yeast</h3><p>The first step in making Parker House Rolls is to activate the yeast. To do this, add the active dry yeast to a small bowl with about 1/4 cup of warm water and a teaspoon of sugar. Stir the mixture gently to combine and allow it to sit for about 5 to 10 minutes. You&rsquo;ll know the yeast is ready when it becomes foamy and starts to bubble. This means the yeast is active and ready to help your rolls rise.</p><h3 id=2-prepare-the-dough>2. Prepare the Dough</h3><p>While your yeast is proofing, prepare the dry ingredients. In a large mixing bowl, combine 4 cups of all-purpose flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt. Stir them together to ensure that the salt is evenly distributed throughout the flour.</p><p>Next, warm 1 cup of whole milk in a saucepan over low heat. You want it to be warm but not hot, about 110°F (43°C). Once the milk is warm, remove it from the heat and stir in 1/4 cup of melted butter. Let the milk mixture cool down for a couple of minutes before adding it to the flour mixture.</p><p>Now, add the activated yeast to the flour and milk mixture along with one egg. Mix everything together using a wooden spoon or spatula. The dough should start coming together and pulling away from the sides of the bowl. If the dough feels too sticky, add more flour, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the right consistency. The dough should be soft and slightly tacky but not overly sticky.</p><h3 id=3-knead-the-dough>3. Knead the Dough</h3><p>Once the dough has come together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough for about 8 to 10 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. Kneading is essential to develop the gluten, which gives the rolls their fluffy texture. If the dough is sticking to your hands or the work surface, sprinkle a small amount of flour as needed.</p><p>After kneading, form the dough into a ball and place it back into the mixing bowl. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let it rise in a warm, draft-free area for about 1 to 1.5 hours. The dough should double in size during this time. If you’re short on time, you can place the bowl in a slightly warm oven (with the heat turned off) to speed up the rising process.</p><h3 id=4-shape-the-rolls>4. Shape the Rolls</h3><p>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and gently roll it out into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Using a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut the dough into squares or rectangles, approximately 2 to 3 inches wide.</p><p>Now comes the signature part of Parker House Rolls: folding. To shape the rolls, take each rectangle of dough and fold it in half lengthwise, so it forms a slightly curved shape. This gives the rolls their iconic look and helps them bake evenly.</p><h3 id=5-arrange-the-rolls-in-a-pan>5. Arrange the Rolls in a Pan</h3><p>Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish or a similar-sized pan. Arrange the shaped rolls in the pan, making sure they’re snug but not overly crowded. The rolls should be placed close together so that they rise up rather than spread out during baking. Once the rolls are arranged, cover the pan with a towel and let the dough rise for another 30 to 45 minutes. The rolls should puff up and fill the pan.</p><h3 id=6-preheat-the-oven>6. Preheat the Oven</h3><p>While the rolls are undergoing their second rise, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). This ensures that the oven is at the right temperature when the rolls are ready to bake.</p><h3 id=7-bake-the-rolls>7. Bake the Rolls</h3><p>Once the rolls have risen, it&rsquo;s time to bake them. Place the pan of rolls in the preheated oven and bake for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and the rolls sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.</p><h3 id=8-brush-with-butter>8. Brush with Butter</h3><p>When the rolls are done, remove them from the oven and immediately brush them with melted butter. This will give them an extra rich, buttery flavor and a shiny, golden finish. You can also sprinkle a little bit of sea salt on top for added flavor.</p><h3 id=9-cool-and-serve>9. Cool and Serve</h3><p>Allow the rolls to cool for a few minutes before serving. These rolls are best enjoyed warm but can be stored in an airtight container for a couple of days. Reheat them in the oven or microwave for a few seconds before serving to bring back their soft, fluffy texture.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-parker-house-rolls>Tips for Perfect Parker House Rolls</h2><ul><li><strong>Use fresh yeast</strong>: If your yeast is expired or not active, your rolls won’t rise properly. Always check the expiration date on the yeast package and test it before using it in your recipe.</li><li><strong>Don’t skip the second rise</strong>: The second rise is essential for achieving the light, airy texture that makes Parker House Rolls so irresistible. Be patient and let the dough rise properly.</li><li><strong>Temperature matters</strong>: The milk and water should be warm but not hot when added to the dough. If the temperature is too high, it can kill the yeast, preventing the dough from rising. Aim for a temperature of around 110°F (43°C).</li><li><strong>Don’t overwork the dough</strong>: Overkneading the dough can result in dense rolls. Be sure to knead it just enough to develop the gluten without overworking it.</li><li><strong>Add flavor variations</strong>: While the traditional Parker House Roll recipe is simple and delicious, you can experiment with adding ingredients like garlic, herbs, or cheese to give your rolls an extra flavor boost.</li></ul><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3 id=can-i-make-these-rolls-ahead-of-time>Can I make these rolls ahead of time?</h3><p>Yes! You can prepare the dough the night before and let it rise in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning, let the dough come to room temperature, shape the rolls, and allow them to rise again before baking.</p><h3 id=can-i-freeze-parker-house-rolls>Can I freeze Parker House Rolls?</h3><p>Absolutely! After baking, let the rolls cool completely, then wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and aluminum foil. You can store them in the freezer for up to 3 months. To reheat, simply thaw them in the refrigerator overnight and warm them in the oven before serving.</p><h3 id=can-i-use-a-stand-mixer-to-knead-the-dough>Can I use a stand mixer to knead the dough?</h3><p>Yes, you can use a stand mixer with a dough hook to knead the dough. This can save time and effort, especially if you’re making a large batch. Just make sure to knead the dough on medium speed for about 5 to 6 minutes until it’s smooth and elastic.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Making the fluffiest Parker House Rolls at home is a rewarding experience that results in soft, buttery, and delicious rolls that will impress your family and guests.
