Whether you&rsquo;re preparing it for a family dinner or a cozy night in, this potato soup will quickly become a favorite.</p><p>In this blog post, I’ll guide you step by step through the process of making the best potato soup in your slow cooker. You’ll also find tips for customizing the recipe and answers to common questions about ingredients and variations. Let’s dive into how you can make this perfect potato soup with minimal effort and maximum flavor!</p><h2 id=why-use-a-slow-cooker-for-potato-soup>Why Use a Slow Cooker for Potato Soup?</h2><p>Using a slow cooker (also known as a Crockpot) is an excellent way to make potato soup for several reasons:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Convenience</strong>: The slow cooker does the work for you. Once you’ve prepped the ingredients, you simply set it and forget it. This makes it perfect for busy days when you want a satisfying meal with little hands-on time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flavor Development</strong>: Slow cooking allows the flavors to meld together over time. As the potatoes cook slowly, they absorb the broth and seasonings, making each bite rich and flavorful.</p></li><li><p><strong>Creaminess</strong>: The slow cooker is perfect for creating that creamy, smooth texture. The potatoes break down as they cook, giving the soup a luscious consistency without the need for heavy cream or a ton of butter.</p></li></ol><h2 id=ingredients-youll-need>Ingredients You’ll Need</h2><p>Here’s a list of the ingredients you’ll need to make this comforting potato soup:</p><ul><li><strong>Russet Potatoes</strong>: These starchy potatoes are perfect for making creamy soups. They break down beautifully when cooked and give the soup its desired thickness.</li><li><strong>Bacon</strong>: The crispy bacon adds a delicious smoky flavor to the soup. You can also use turkey bacon if you want a lighter option, but regular bacon is highly recommended for the best flavor.</li><li><strong>Onion</strong>: Chopped onions add depth and a subtle sweetness to the soup. They cook down in the slow cooker and provide a fantastic base flavor.</li><li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Fresh garlic enhances the flavor profile and adds an aromatic touch to the soup.</li><li><strong>Chicken Broth</strong>: Using chicken broth (or vegetable broth for a vegetarian version) helps bring all the flavors together. It also adds to the soup’s richness without being too heavy.</li><li><strong>Cheddar Cheese</strong>: Sharp cheddar cheese is the star when it comes to flavor. It melts beautifully into the soup, creating a creamy, cheesy base that’s utterly irresistible.</li><li><strong>Heavy Cream</strong>: For that extra creamy texture, a bit of heavy cream at the end will elevate the soup and make it incredibly smooth.</li><li><strong>Milk</strong>: Adding milk helps balance the richness of the cream, giving the soup a more traditional consistency.</li><li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: Salt, pepper, and dried thyme will bring all the flavors to life. You can also add a pinch of paprika or a dash of cayenne pepper if you like a little heat.</li><li><strong>Green Onions</strong>: For garnish, chopped green onions provide a fresh, crunchy contrast to the creamy soup.</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-make-slow-cooker-potato-soup-with-bacon-and-cheese>How to Make Slow Cooker Potato Soup with Bacon and Cheese</h2><p>Making potato soup in the slow cooker is easy and requires minimal effort. Here&rsquo;s a step-by-step guide to creating this satisfying dish:</p><h3 id=step-1-prepare-the-ingredients>Step 1: Prepare the Ingredients</h3><p>Start by prepping all your ingredients. Wash and peel the potatoes, then cut them into small cubes. This ensures they cook quickly and evenly in the slow cooker.</p><p>Next, chop the onion and garlic. You can also cut the bacon into small pieces for easy crisping later on. Set all of these aside.</p><h3 id=step-2-brown-the-bacon>Step 2: Brown the Bacon</h3><p>While not strictly necessary, browning the bacon first enhances its flavor. Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and add the chopped bacon. Cook until crispy, which should take about 5–7 minutes. Once done, transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess fat. Leave a little bit of bacon grease in the skillet to sauté the onion and garlic.</p><h3 id=step-3-sauté-the-onion-and-garlic>Step 3: Sauté the Onion and Garlic</h3><p>In the same skillet, add the chopped onion and garlic. Sauté for about 2–3 minutes until they become fragrant and softened. This step adds an extra layer of flavor to the soup, making it even more aromatic. Afterward, transfer the onion and garlic mixture to the slow cooker.</p><h3 id=step-4-add-the-potatoes-and-broth>Step 4: Add the Potatoes and Broth</h3><p>Add the cubed potatoes to the slow cooker along with the chicken broth. Make sure the broth covers the potatoes—if not, add a bit more broth or water to ensure the potatoes are submerged. Season with salt, pepper, and thyme. Stir everything together, then cover the slow cooker and cook on low for 6–7 hours or on high for 3–4 hours.</p><h3 id=step-5-mash-the-potatoes>Step 5: Mash the Potatoes</h3><p>Once the potatoes are tender, it’s time to mash them. You can either use a potato masher for a chunkier texture or an immersion blender if you prefer a smoother soup. Mash until you reach your desired consistency. Some people like their potato soup a bit rustic, while others prefer it velvety smooth.</p><h3 id=step-6-add-the-cream-and-cheese>Step 6: Add the Cream and Cheese</h3><p>After mashing, add the heavy cream and milk to the soup and stir well to combine. The cream will make the soup extra silky and indulgent. Then, add the shredded cheddar cheese and continue stirring until the cheese is fully melted and the soup is creamy.</p><h3 id=step-7-add-the-bacon>Step 7: Add the Bacon</h3><p>Now that your soup is creamy and cheesy, it&rsquo;s time to add the crispy bacon. Stir in most of the bacon pieces, saving some for garnish. The bacon adds that perfect crispy contrast to the rich, creamy soup. Taste the soup and adjust the seasonings if necessary, adding more salt or pepper as desired.</p><h3 id=step-8-serve-and-garnish>Step 8: Serve and Garnish</h3><p>Ladle the hot soup into bowls and garnish with the reserved bacon, shredded cheddar cheese, and chopped green onions. If you like, you can even add a dollop of sour cream for an extra creamy touch.</p><h2 id=tips-for-customizing-your-potato-soup>Tips for Customizing Your Potato Soup</h2><p>While this recipe is delicious on its own, there are a few ways to customize it to suit your tastes:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Add More Veggies</strong>: Feel free to throw in additional vegetables like carrots, celery, or even corn. Simply chop them up and add them to the slow cooker along with the potatoes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make It Spicy</strong>: If you like a little heat, try adding a pinch of cayenne pepper or some finely diced jalapeños. This will give the soup a nice kick without overwhelming the flavors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Different Cheeses</strong>: While sharp cheddar is classic, you can experiment with other cheeses like Monterey Jack, Gouda, or mozzarella. Mixing cheeses can create a more complex flavor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add Protein</strong>: For a heartier soup, you can add cooked chicken, sausage, or even ham. Just make sure to add them near the end of cooking so they don’t overcook.</p></li><li><p><strong>Go Vegetarian</strong>: To make this potato soup vegetarian, simply swap the chicken broth for vegetable broth, omit the bacon, and use a plant-based cheese. The soup will still be rich and flavorful.</p></li></ol><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-about-potato-soup>Frequently Asked Questions About Potato Soup</h2><h3 id=can-i-make-this-soup-ahead-of-time>Can I make this soup ahead of time?</h3><p>Yes! This potato soup actually tastes even better the next day as the flavors continue to develop. You can store it in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze it for up to 3 months. Just be sure to let the soup cool completely before refrigerating or freezing.</p><h3 id=can-i-use-pre-cooked-bacon>Can I use pre-cooked bacon?</h3><p>Yes, you can use pre-cooked bacon if you&rsquo;re short on time. Just chop it up and add it to the soup as directed, but keep in mind that pre-cooked bacon won’t add the same depth of flavor as freshly cooked bacon.</p><h3 id=can-i-make-this-soup-without-cream>Can I make this soup without cream?</h3><p>Yes, you can reduce or eliminate the heavy cream if you prefer a lighter version of the soup. Use extra milk or broth to adjust the consistency. The soup will still be delicious and creamy, though it will have a slightly different texture.</p><h3 id=can-i-use-frozen-potatoes>Can I use frozen potatoes?</h3><p>While fresh potatoes are preferred for this recipe, you can use frozen hashbrowns or diced frozen potatoes as a shortcut. Just make sure to adjust the cooking time, as frozen potatoes may cook faster than fresh ones.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>This Slow Cooker Potato Soup with Bacon and Cheese is a comforting and flavorful dish that’s perfect for any occasion.
