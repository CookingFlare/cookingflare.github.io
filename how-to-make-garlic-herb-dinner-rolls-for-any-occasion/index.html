Whether you&rsquo;re preparing a casual weeknight dinner, hosting a holiday feast, or attending a potluck, these rolls are a crowd-pleaser that will elevate any meal.</p><p>In this recipe, we’ll walk you through how to make these flavorful dinner rolls step-by-step. From preparing the dough to baking them to perfection, we’ll cover everything you need to know to ensure your garlic herb rolls turn out delicious every time.</p><h3 id=ingredients-for-garlic-herb-dinner-rolls>Ingredients for Garlic Herb Dinner Rolls</h3><p>To make these garlic herb dinner rolls, you&rsquo;ll need the following ingredients:</p><ul><li><strong>3 ½ cups all-purpose flour</strong> – This is the base for your dough. You can substitute some of this with whole wheat flour for a heartier texture if desired.</li><li><strong>1 packet active dry yeast</strong> (about 2 ¼ teaspoons) – Yeast is what makes the rolls rise and gives them that signature fluffy texture.</li><li><strong>¼ cup warm water</strong> – The water should be warm, but not too hot, as it helps activate the yeast.</li><li><strong>2 teaspoons sugar</strong> – A little sugar helps feed the yeast and contributes to the overall flavor.</li><li><strong>1 cup milk</strong> – Full-fat milk is ideal for a rich and soft roll, but you can substitute it with almond milk or other milk alternatives.</li><li><strong>1/4 cup unsalted butter</strong> (melted) – This will give the rolls a rich flavor and softness.</li><li><strong>1 teaspoon salt</strong> – Enhances the overall taste of the bread.</li><li><strong>1 egg</strong> – Adds structure and richness to the dough.</li><li><strong>4 cloves garlic</strong> (minced) – The star of the flavor show! Fresh garlic will infuse the rolls with its irresistible aroma.</li><li><strong>1 tablespoon fresh rosemary</strong> (chopped) – Fresh herbs like rosemary add a fragrant, earthy flavor that pairs beautifully with garlic.</li><li><strong>1 tablespoon fresh thyme</strong> (chopped) – Thyme adds a subtle, savory note that balances the garlic and rosemary.</li><li><strong>1 tablespoon fresh parsley</strong> (chopped) – This herb brings a bright, fresh touch to the rolls.</li><li><strong>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</strong> – Optional but adds a savory, cheesy crust that takes these rolls to the next level.</li></ul><h3 id=step-by-step-guide-to-making-garlic-herb-dinner-rolls>Step-by-Step Guide to Making Garlic Herb Dinner Rolls</h3><h4 id=step-1-prepare-the-yeast-mixture>Step 1: Prepare the Yeast Mixture</h4><p>Start by activating your yeast. In a small bowl, combine the <strong>warm water</strong> and <strong>sugar</strong>. Stir the mixture and then sprinkle the <strong>active dry yeast</strong> over the top. Let it sit for about 5 to 10 minutes. The yeast should start to bubble and foam, indicating it’s alive and ready to go. If it doesn’t foam, your yeast might be expired, and it’s time to try a fresh packet.</p><h4 id=step-2-make-the-dough>Step 2: Make the Dough</h4><p>While the yeast is proofing, prepare your dry ingredients. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the <strong>flour</strong> and <strong>salt</strong>. Once the yeast has foamed, add it to the flour mixture along with <strong>milk</strong>, <strong>melted butter</strong>, and <strong>egg</strong>. Stir with a wooden spoon or a dough hook on a stand mixer until the dough begins to come together.</p><h4 id=step-3-knead-the-dough>Step 3: Knead the Dough</h4><p>Now it’s time to knead the dough. If you’re kneading by hand, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 8 to 10 minutes, until it becomes smooth and elastic. If you&rsquo;re using a stand mixer, knead the dough on medium speed for about 5 minutes. The dough should feel slightly tacky but not sticky.</p><h4 id=step-4-incorporate-garlic-and-herbs>Step 4: Incorporate Garlic and Herbs</h4><p>Once the dough has come together and is kneaded to a smooth consistency, add your minced garlic, <strong>rosemary</strong>, <strong>thyme</strong>, and <strong>parsley</strong>. Knead these ingredients into the dough until they’re evenly distributed. The fresh herbs and garlic will give the rolls their signature flavor and aroma, and you’ll love how the dough transforms as it picks up these savory notes.</p><h4 id=step-5-let-the-dough-rise>Step 5: Let the Dough Rise</h4><p>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap. Let it rise in a warm place for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size. This rise is essential for creating the light, airy texture of the rolls, so be patient and let the dough do its thing.</p><h4 id=step-6-shape-the-rolls>Step 6: Shape the Rolls</h4><p>After the dough has risen, punch it down gently to release any air bubbles. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and divide it into 12 equal portions. Shape each portion into a small ball by folding the edges of the dough underneath to create a smooth surface on top. This will help the rolls hold their shape during baking.</p><p>Place the shaped rolls into a greased 9x13-inch baking dish, arranging them so they are close together but not touching. This will help them rise upward as they bake, creating soft and fluffy rolls with golden, slightly crisp tops.</p><h4 id=step-7-second-rise>Step 7: Second Rise</h4><p>Cover the baking dish with a kitchen towel and allow the rolls to rise for another 30 minutes to an hour. This second rise is important for the rolls to puff up before baking.</p><h4 id=step-8-bake-the-rolls>Step 8: Bake the Rolls</h4><p>While the rolls are rising, preheat your oven to <strong>350°F (175°C)</strong>. Once the rolls have completed their second rise, place them in the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and the rolls sound hollow when tapped. The exact time may vary slightly depending on your oven, so keep an eye on them.</p><h4 id=step-9-brush-with-garlic-butter>Step 9: Brush with Garlic Butter</h4><p>To give your garlic herb dinner rolls that irresistible finishing touch, melt a couple of tablespoons of <strong>butter</strong> in a small saucepan. Add a clove of minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes, just enough to release the garlic&rsquo;s aroma without burning it. Once your rolls are out of the oven, brush them generously with the garlic butter mixture. This will add a layer of flavor that elevates the garlic-herb experience.</p><h4 id=step-10-optional-parmesan-topping>Step 10: Optional Parmesan Topping</h4><p>For an extra indulgent touch, sprinkle some grated <strong>Parmesan cheese</strong> over the rolls before baking. The cheese will melt into the crust, creating a crispy, cheesy exterior that perfectly complements the soft interior. This step is optional, but it adds a savory depth of flavor that will make your rolls even more irresistible.</p><h4 id=step-11-serve-and-enjoy>Step 11: Serve and Enjoy</h4><p>Once your garlic herb dinner rolls have cooled slightly, they’re ready to be served! These rolls are best enjoyed warm, with a spread of butter, olive oil, or even a light drizzle of honey for a sweet-savory contrast. Whether you&rsquo;re serving them alongside pasta, roasted meats, or a simple salad, they’ll be the star of the show.</p><h3 id=tips-for-perfect-garlic-herb-dinner-rolls>Tips for Perfect Garlic Herb Dinner Rolls</h3><ol><li><strong>Don’t Overmix the Dough</strong>: Overmixing the dough can result in dense, tough rolls. Mix the ingredients until they’re just combined and knead until smooth, but avoid overworking the dough.</li><li><strong>Use Fresh Herbs</strong>: Fresh garlic and herbs are key to getting that fresh, fragrant flavor. Dried herbs may be substituted in a pinch, but the flavor won’t be quite as vibrant.</li><li><strong>Let the Dough Rise Properly</strong>: Don’t rush the rise. The first rise allows the yeast to work its magic and develop the flavor, while the second rise helps the rolls get their fluffy texture.</li><li><strong>Customize the Herbs</strong>: If you&rsquo;re not a fan of rosemary or thyme, feel free to substitute other fresh herbs like basil, oregano, or sage.</li><li><strong>Make Ahead</strong>: You can prepare the dough ahead of time and store it in the fridge for up to 24 hours before baking. Just let it come to room temperature and go through the second rise before baking.</li><li><strong>Freezing</strong>: These rolls freeze wonderfully. After baking, allow them to cool completely, then wrap them in plastic wrap and aluminum foil before freezing. To reheat, wrap them in foil and bake in a 350°F oven for about 10 minutes.</li></ol><h3 id=why-youll-love-these-garlic-herb-dinner-rolls>Why You’ll Love These Garlic Herb Dinner Rolls</h3><p>Garlic herb dinner rolls are perfect for any occasion because they combine the best of both worlds: soft, fluffy bread with the bold, savory flavor of garlic and fresh herbs.
