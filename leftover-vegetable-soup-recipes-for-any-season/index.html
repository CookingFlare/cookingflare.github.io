For extra depth of flavor, homemade stock is a great option.</li><li><strong>Olive Oil or Butter</strong>: These are used to sauté the vegetables at the beginning of the recipe. Olive oil is a healthier option, but butter provides a rich, savory flavor.</li><li><strong>Aromatics</strong>: Onions, garlic, and celery are commonly used to build the flavor base of your soup. Carrots are also a great addition for sweetness and depth.</li><li><strong>Seasonings</strong>: Salt, pepper, and dried herbs like thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves are essential. Depending on the flavor profile you&rsquo;re going for, you can experiment with additional spices such as cumin, paprika, or turmeric.</li><li><strong>Leftover Vegetables</strong>: This is where you can get creative! Leftover vegetables can include almost anything—leafy greens like spinach or kale, root vegetables like potatoes, sweet potatoes, or carrots, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli or cauliflower, and even tomatoes or bell peppers.</li><li><strong>Optional Add-ins</strong>: You can add grains (quinoa, rice, or barley), beans (like white beans, kidney beans, or chickpeas), or cooked meat (chicken, sausage, or bacon) to make the soup more hearty.</li></ol><p>With these basic ingredients, you can make a soup with whatever vegetables you have left in the fridge.
