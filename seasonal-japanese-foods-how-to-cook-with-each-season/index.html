Central to this culinary tradition is the concept of "shun," which refers to the seasonality of ingredients—the idea that certain foods taste best when they are in season. This philosophy encourages cooks to embrace fresh, local ingredients that embody the essence of each season. In this blog post, we will explore the seasonal foods of Japan, offering recipes and cooking tips to help you enjoy these vibrant flavors throughout the year.
Spring: Embracing Renewal
Spring in Japan signals rebirth and renewal, traditionally celebrated through the cherry blossom season, known as "hanami." With warming weather, vibrant colors, and fresh produce, spring inspires a variety of culinary delights.
Notable Ingredients</p><p>Sakura (Cherry Blossoms): These iconic flowers bloom in early spring and can be used to create delicate sweets or infused teas.

Sakura mochi is a sweet rice cake wrapped in cherry blossom leaves, which adds a fragrant touch.
Ingredients</p><p>1 cup sweet rice (glutinous rice)
1 cup water

1/4 teaspoon salt
6-8 cherry blossom leaves (brined or salted)
Red bean paste (anko) for filling</p><p>Instructions</p><p>Preparation of Sweet Rice: Rinse the sweet rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for at least 2 hours or overnight for better texture.</p><p>Cooking the Rice: In a steamer or rice cooker, steam the soaked rice for 30-40 minutes until fully cooked and sticky.</p><p>Mixing Ingredients: In a bowl, combine the cooked rice, sugar, and salt while it’s still warm.
