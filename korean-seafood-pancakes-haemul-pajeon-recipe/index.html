If you’re using shrimp, squid, and mussels, make sure they are cleaned, peeled, and chopped into bite-sized pieces. For a fresh seafood taste, it’s best to use a combination of seafood that’s available to you—shrimp, squid, and even clams or mussels work perfectly in this dish.</p><p>Once your seafood is ready, place it in a bowl and set it aside. You can mix all the seafood together, or you can keep the different types separate, depending on your preference.</p><h3 id=step-2-prepare-the-vegetables>Step 2: Prepare the Vegetables</h3><p>Slice the onion and bell pepper thinly. Cut the green onions into 2-inch pieces. You can also add a handful of fresh herbs, such as cilantro, for a bit of extra flavor and freshness. The vegetables add a nice crunch and contrast to the soft seafood in the pancake.</p><h3 id=step-3-make-the-batter>Step 3: Make the Batter</h3><p>In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, rice flour, cornstarch, salt, and black pepper. Stir until evenly mixed. Add the egg, and slowly incorporate the cold water, mixing as you go. The batter should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon but still pourable. If it’s too thick, add a little more water to achieve the right consistency. The sesame oil is added to enhance the flavor of the batter and give it a subtle depth.</p><p>Whisk the batter until smooth and no lumps remain. A well-mixed batter is crucial to ensuring a crispy and light pancake.</p><h3 id=step-4-combine-seafood-and-vegetables-with-the-batter>Step 4: Combine Seafood and Vegetables with the Batter</h3><p>Once your batter is ready, fold in the seafood and vegetables. Gently stir until everything is evenly coated in the batter. The seafood and vegetables should be well-distributed so that each bite is filled with flavors and textures.</p><h3 id=step-5-cook-the-haemul-pajeon>Step 5: Cook the Haemul Pajeon</h3><p>Heat a non-stick or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Add a generous amount of vegetable oil to the pan, ensuring it covers the bottom evenly. The oil helps achieve that golden, crispy texture on the outside of the pancake.</p><p>Once the oil is hot, pour the batter into the skillet, spreading it out evenly. You want the pancake to be about 1/2 inch thick so that it cooks properly and crisps up nicely on the edges. Press down gently to flatten it out.</p><p>Cook the pancake for about 4-5 minutes on the first side until it turns golden brown and crispy. Flip the pancake carefully using a spatula, and cook for another 3-4 minutes on the other side until it’s golden and cooked through. Be patient and avoid turning the pancake too early, as this can cause it to fall apart.</p><h3 id=step-6-prepare-the-dipping-sauce>Step 6: Prepare the Dipping Sauce</h3><p>While the pancake is cooking, prepare the dipping sauce. In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, garlic, and optional chili flakes or gochujang for a spicy kick. Stir until the sugar dissolves and everything is well-combined. Sprinkle a few sesame seeds on top for an extra touch of flavor.</p><h3 id=step-7-serve-and-enjoy>Step 7: Serve and Enjoy</h3><p>Once the Haemul Pajeon is cooked to a crisp, remove it from the skillet and place it on a plate. You can cut it into wedges like a pizza or serve it whole, depending on your preference. Serve it with the dipping sauce on the side for guests to dip their pancakes into.</p><p>Haemul Pajeon is best enjoyed fresh and hot, but if you have leftovers, you can store them in the fridge and reheat them in a skillet for that crispy texture. It makes for an excellent snack, appetizer, or light meal.</p><h2 id=tips-for-perfect-haemul-pajeon>Tips for Perfect Haemul Pajeon</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Use cold water for the batter</strong>: This is crucial for making a crispy and light pancake. Cold water helps prevent the batter from becoming too runny and ensures that the pancake has a nice, crispy texture on the outside.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t overcrowd the pan</strong>: For the best results, cook the pancakes one at a time. If you add too much batter to the pan, it can become difficult to flip and may not cook evenly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customize your seafood</strong>: Haemul Pajeon is a versatile dish, and you can adjust the type of seafood based on what you like. You can even use just one type of seafood, such as shrimp or squid, or add more variety for a richer taste.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make it spicier</strong>: If you enjoy a bit of heat, add more chili flakes or gochujang to the dipping sauce, or even directly to the batter.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ensure a crispy edge</strong>: Adding sesame oil to the batter and using enough oil in the pan will help achieve that signature crispy edge that makes Haemul Pajeon so irresistible.</p></li></ul><h2 id=why-youll-love-haemul-pajeon>Why You’ll Love Haemul Pajeon</h2><p>Korean seafood pancakes are not only delicious but also quite simple to make.
